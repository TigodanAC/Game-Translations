    e "Hi, [P], It's so good to see you today."

    e "You know, after Theodora moved out, this house became... empty. Thanks for coming and making this place lively again."

    player "Don't mention it, Aunt Elisa. This place is like the second home to me. I enjoy coming here every time."

    narrator "I'm saying the truth. I do have a deep feeling about this mansion. "

    narrator "5 years ago when I was still in high school, my dad went abroad on business for half a year. Before he left, he asked Aunt Elisa to look after me. So during the time when he was not here, I lived with Aunt Elisa's family in this mansion all along. "

    narrator "That was quite a memory."

    e "You know, your father and I, we used to have arguments about your family education. I thought he spoiled you too much."

    e "But I'm not your mother, so I don't have the right to put my oar in his decision. "

    e "But this time we had a consensus. He agreed with me that we should let you explore your life more on your own."
