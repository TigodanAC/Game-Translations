    player "Irene, are you there?"

    player "I'm coming in... We have a lot of review need to do today, no time to waste."

    narrator "I opened the door of Irene's room."

    player "What... the... hell... ..."

    narrator "And I was deeply shocked by what I saw."

    scene rcsj_d17 with tstmgr

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    player "(A... A bunny girl?)"

    player "(Why there is a bunny girl in Irene's room?)"

    narrator "I was utterly speechless for at least 10 seconds. I could do nothing but stare at this bunny girl without a blink."

    scene rcsj_d18_1 with tstmgr

    narrator "Those legs with fishnet stockings on... They are just amazing."

    scene rcsj_d18 with tstmgr

    narrator "She seemed surprised as well, but her expression didn't change much. That's kinda unusual. I mean, she is being seen by a stranger when she is doing an embarrassed pose in an embarrassed costume. Normal girls would have just screamed out."

    narrator "Who is this girl?"

    player "(Closing eyes) I... I... I am sorry. I was looking for Irene, didn't know you are here."

    "???" "It's... fine."

    narrator "Her voice is shrill like a 10-year-old but she keeps it in a mild volume. I only heard this kind of voice in cartoons before."

    player "Eh..., Who are you?"

    "???" "... ... ... ..."

    player "I'm sorry, it's not a good time to chat. I'm going to leave the room right now. Again, I'm sorry for coming in without your permission."

    player "My name is [P], by the way."

    "???" "... ... ... ..."

    "???" "You can call me... Uno."

    narrator "Uno? I think I have heard it before."

    narrator "I mean, it's a famous card game name so... But no, I must have heard it from elsewhere."

    pause

    player "Did you just say “hentai”? Where did you learn that word from?"

    d "From a friend on the internet. Why do you care?"

    player " Are you sure that’s a good guy? Because that's not a good word."

    scene rcsj_d6 with tstmgr

    d "Emm... Her name is Uno."

    player "A her?"

    scene rcsj_d9 with tstmgr

    d "Yes, and she is a coser. Have you heard of that name? She is kinda famous in the cosplay circle. "

    scene rcsj_d18 with flashback

    narrator "Okay, now I know who she is."

    player "So you are Irene's friend?"

    g "Irene?"

    narrator "Uno seemed not to recognize that name. She was a little confused, but her expression still stayed unchanged."

    player "I mean, the girl who lives in this room?"

    g "Oh."

    g "I know her as S.C. We don't use our real name on the internet."

    player "S.C? What does that stand for?"

    g "... ... ... ..."

    g "Stratholme Culler."

    player "You gotta be kidding me..."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "Anyway... So, Uno is not your real name, either, right?"

    g "It's not."

    player "And you won't tell me what your real name is?"

    scene rcsj_d18_2 with tstmgr

    narrator "She slightly shook her head."

    player "Fine, it's okay. Eh... so where is our... Stratholme Culler?"

    g "In the restroom, I guess."

    player "Okay, okay. I'll just go wait for her outside."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "I'm sorry, but why are you keeping this pose?"

    g "Preparing for the next Comic-Con."

    narrator "Oh, right, she is a cosplayer. "

    narrator "And I think that's why she didn't scream out when I broke into this room. She has already got used to being stared at by others when doing poses."

    player "Okay, I get it. I'll just... leave you alone."

    narrator "I left the room and closed the door."

    narrator "And I saw Irene coming out of the restroom."

    d "Hi, [P]. You came earlier today."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "I just met with your friend Uno."

    d "You did? Isn't she great?"

    player "Yeah, she's great. But..."

    player "Stratholme Culler? Really?"

    d "What's wrong with that name? It took me one night to come up with. "

    player "Well... It's indeed a unique name."

    scene d_mansion_inside_notsosmile with tstmgr
