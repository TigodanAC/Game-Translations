    "I replayed that video over and over again and couldn’t help jerking off twice. Ah... ... damn... ..."



    "So it really happened. Aunt Элиза really fucked me while I was asleep."



    "Should I be angry about it? Hmmmmm... I don’t know. Somebody may count that as rape, but... ... I don’t feel like I was a victim or something, not at all."



    "Aunt Элиза was one of the sexiest women I know and I couldn’t remember how many times I have masturbated while imagining her during my teenage years."



    "I began to dream about having sex with her ever since I figured out what sex means, and now this dream has come true, but... ..."



    "It feels strange, man, it feels strange..."



    "I mean, Aunt Элиза and I, we have done something across the line before, but those were more like... some naughty pranks between a lustful young man and his lonely auntie."

    player "Элиза... ... ... ..."



    "So how do I really feel about her? Do I love her? Yeah, I absolutely do, but what kind of love is that?"



    "Do I love her because I take her as a half-mother of mine, or is there something more?"

    e "Oh, good afternoon, [P]. You are here for the tutoring? Айрин is already in her room, you can just go find her."



    "She acted normally just as before like nothing had happened, but her blushed face has sold her out."



    player "Aunt Элиза, I... ..."



    "Should I confess to her that I have known what happened that night?"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    scene e_daily11_2 with tstmgr

    e "Is there something wrong, honey?"



    "No, I can’t tell her now. It will definitely make her super embarrassed, and the more important thing is, I don’t even know what result I am seeking to get. Do I want her apology? Do I want to be more intimate with her? Damn, I don’t know..."



    "I should wait until I get ready, or in other words, I should wait until I figure out how I really feel about her."



    player "No, I was just... ... I don’t know. I was in a daze."

    scene e_daily11_14 with tstmgr

    player "... ... ... ..."



    "Yeah, that might be just a joke, but Айрин was right. I will also worry about Aunt Элиза if she gets in love with someone else because I know she is not good at managing a relationship."
