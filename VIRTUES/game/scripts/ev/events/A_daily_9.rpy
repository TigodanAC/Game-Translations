    "Restaurateur" "Hey, [P]. Do you know what happened to Vera? She hasn't been herself lately."

    "Restaurateur" "I'm worried about her."

    player "Uh... she and I, we... had some issues lately."

    "Restaurateur" "What did you do to her?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    "Restaurateur" "I see... ..."

    "Restaurateur" "You know, she always came to me and asked about you. "

    player "For real?"

    "Restaurateur" "Yeah, and she would be very happy every time I'd tell a joke about you or simply praise you for something."

    "Restaurateur" "She likes you, kid, even a fool can see that, but what do you think of her exactly? Do you like her as well?"

    "Restaurateur" "You two now live together and you come to pick her up every time when she gets off work, but you kept telling me that she is only a normal friend to you. That's confusing, don't you think?"

    "Restaurateur" "You can't just maintain this ambiguous relationship with her forever. That's irresponsible for both of you. If you like her, then tell her. If you don't, then stop acting like you do."

    player "I... ..."

    "He is right. I need to tell Vera what I think."

    "But, what do I think of Vera, exactly?"
