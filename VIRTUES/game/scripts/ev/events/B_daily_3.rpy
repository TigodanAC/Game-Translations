    player "Eh, yeah, everything seems fine."

    player "And actually, now I have also started my own business besides those two jobs."

    b "Your own business? What does that mean?"

    narrator "Should I tell her about the B&B stuff now?"

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Nevermind, I will tell her about it after I make sure the business is on the right track."

    player "I would like to keep that as a secret for now, because this business is still in an early stage. I'm not sure how far it will go. You don't need to know that since I may shut it down at any time."

    b "If there is anything I can help with, please please let me know. I really want to do something for you."

    player "I appreciate it, Sen. It's my luck to have a friend like you. In fact, I do need to ask you for a favor."

    b "Just say it, whatever it is."

    player "Thank you."

    player "Well, you see, I may be not able to have as much time to spend on studying as before."

    b "I understand that. You will definitely have a lot of business things to worry about in the future."

    player "So if I happen to miss one course or two, will you help me review the lessons?"

    scene b_class_smile with tstmgr

    b "Sure, no problem at all. You don't even need to mention that."

    player "Thank you, Сеннин."

    b "By the way, [P.name], do you have any place to stay? I know you lived in a hotel before all these happened, but now you would not be able to afford it anymore, right?"

    player "Yes, I've already moved out from it. Don't worry, my father left me a house in this city before he got in trouble. Now I'm living in that place."

    b "It's nice to hear that."
