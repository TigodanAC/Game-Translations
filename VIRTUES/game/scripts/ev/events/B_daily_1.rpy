    narrator "Senning and I were having a conversation in the classroom."

    player "So tell me about China. I barely know anything about it."

    scene b_class_normal with tstmgr

    b "What do you want to know about?"

    player "Eh... Let's start with education. How does a Chinese university work? Is it similar to what we have here?"

    b "Basically, yes, they are similar. You need to choose your courses, go to classes, join exams, just like everywhere else."

    b "However, there is a major difference between universities in China and this country."

    player "What is it then?"

    b "Well, most universities in China do not use the GPA system. In other words, it doesn't matter if students get a D or an A in their course."

    b "Once a student reaches a grade higher than F, like D or C minus, he or she will be fine in that course, no negative effect at all."

    player "Don't try to joke me around. How is that even possible? It sounds like a freaking utopian fairy tale."

    b "And even if unfortunately, students fail to pass an exam, it still doesn't matter. They can take a make-up exam as a second chance. Everything will be fine once they pass the make-up exam."

    player "I don't understand... I mean, China has one of the most populations in the world, shouldn't the competition there be more intense?"

    b "Eh, believe me, the competition there is indeed very intense."

    b "But not in the college."

    player "It doesn't make any sense......"

    player "So why did you choose to come to a foreign university at the beginning?"

    scene b_class_normal with tstmgr

    b "Emm... Good question."

    narrator "The professor comes into the classroom at this moment."

    "Professor Keith" "How's it going, everyone? Before we start, let's do the attendance sheet first."

    narrator "Ah... maybe I will ask her that question later."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."
