    narrator "It has been a few days since I posted this house on a B&B website."

    narrator "Vera and I thought it might take a while to have our first guest, but this house has been full of guests ever since day one."

    narrator "I guess it's not too surprising. This house has several advantages that attract people."

    narrator "It's in a wonderful location not far from the university and downtown with lovely decor, private bathrooms in each bedroom, and most importantly, an affordable price. All of these things make it quite popular on the B&B website."

    narrator "Now Vera gets up before dawn every day and quietly cleans the living room and the public bathrooms before cooking breakfast for the guests."

    narrator "She is indeed quite good at cooking, just as what she said."

    narrator "The guests have been impressed by the meals she's prepared and they all want to thank her in person, but Vera is gone by the time they are awake and asleep. Most of them haven't even gotten a chance to meet her yet."

    narrator "So far only one guest has encountered Vera by chance."

    narrator "According to that guest, one night he woke up and went to the kitchen for some water, but suddenly heard a sound from the hallway."

    scene rcsj_a1 with tstmgr

    narrator "He went to the hallway with curiosity and saw that Vera was just coming in the house from outside and changing her shoes."

    narrator "The guest didn't even realize Vera was the mysterious hostess at first. He thought a woman with such great cleaning and cooking skill must not be younger than 30 and did not expect to see a beautiful girl barely over 20."

    scene rcsj_a2 with tstmgr

    narrator "After Vera noticed him, she gave him a warm greeting. Although she was already exhausted from work, her smile was still very energetic."

    scene home_livingroom_night_background with tstmgr

    narrator "When the other guests heard this story, they started to blame me for letting Vera work outside until midnight."

    narrator "Well, I kinda blame myself for that, too."

    narrator "I know Vera is severely overloaded with work. She currently has four jobs to do every day and almost has no time to rest. She only can afford to sleep for about four to five hours a day."

    narrator "My work is so easy compared to hers."

    narrator "I need to find a way to ease her burden. Let's start by helping her with the housekeeping."

    narrator "So I got up very early today and found her in the kitchen."

    scene rcsj_a3 with tstmgr

    player "Morning."

    scene rcsj_a4 with tstmgr

    a "Eh? You got up so early today."

    player "Well, I'm here to help."

    scene rcsj_a5 with tstmgr

    a "That's very kind of you."

    player "So is there anything I can do, ma'am?"

    a "Ma'am? No one's ever called me that before."

    a "If you would like, you can go clean up the living room, but please be quiet. The guests are still in their dreams."

    player "Aye aye, ma'am."

    scene home_livingroom_night_background with tstmgr

    narrator "I took a while to clean the living room. It's not easy to clean without making any noise. I have to be very careful and try twice as hard."

    narrator "It's hard to believe Vera does this willingly every day. It must be painstaking for her."

    narrator "I feel guilty about it."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    scene rcsj_a4 with tstmgr

    a "Have you finished cleaning?"

    player "Ah, yes."

    player "Tomorrow I will do it again. And not just tomorrow, from now on, I will help you with housekeeping every day. Let's do it together."

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "Thank you."

    player "And..."

    scene rcsj_a6 with tstmgr

    a "Is there anything on your mind?"

    player "Well, now that our business is on the right track, have you thought about quitting your other jobs and becoming my full-time B&B assistant?"

    player "I will... I will pay you a wage. It won't be much for now, but at least you won't be so tired every day."

    a "... ... ... ..."

    scene rcsj_a5 with tstmgr

    a "Thank you..."

    a "But no, not yet."

    a "I have to earn as much money as I can to support my mom. I am still young, I can handle all these jobs without a doubt."

    player "But if you keep overburdening yourself with work, your body will break down soon or later."

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "I am okay, don't worry."

    player "But..."

    a "You really don't need to worry about me. I didn't feel any tired."

    narrator "I can't persuade this stubborn girl. She has her own insistence."

    narrator "And I can't force her to quit those jobs, either. I have to respect her choice."

    player "Fine. If you are okay with it, I won't say anything again. But let's make a deal."

    a "What deal?"

    player "Once this B&B business grows big enough, I will pay you wage comparable to all of your current wages combined And you will quit those jobs to be my full-time B&B assistant. Do you accept?"

    scene rcsj_a7 with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "But you don't have to do this."

    player "I insist."

    scene rcsj_a5 with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "Alright, I accept that deal."

    a "Thank you."

    player "Thank you, too."

    scene void with tstmgr

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    player "(I need to do something to make this B&B business more profitable. That's the only way to let Vera quit the other jobs.)"
