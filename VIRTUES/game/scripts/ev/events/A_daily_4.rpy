    narrator "{b}the following plot is from Vera's perspective{/b}"

    narrator "(Door knocking) Knock, knock..."

    narrator "(Door knocking) Knock, knock..."

    a "(Who would come at such an early time?)"

    narrator "I came and opened the door. There is a pretty girl outside. I don't know who she is."

    scene rcsj_a8 with tstmgr

    a "Hello there..."

    a "Are you a reserved guest? I didn't know you would come so early today."

    scene rcsj_a9 with tstmgr

    b "(Surprised) Guest? No, there must be some mistake."

    b "Is this place a B&B house?"

    a "Yes, it is."

    scene rcsj_a10 with tstmgr

    b "(Is [P.name] living here after he lost his financial support?)"

    b "(But... he said he was living in a house his father left him.)"

    scene rcsj_a9 with tstmgr

    b " I'm sorry to bother you, Miss. I am here to find my classmate. He missed two classes earlier this week, and I thought he might need my note to review what he has missed."

    b "He gave me this address a few weeks ago. I think he might be one of your guests?"

    scene rcsj_a11 with tstmgr

    a " What's his name?"

    b "[P.name]."

    scene rcsj_a12 with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "Oh..."

    b "He...... is not living in here?"

    a "Oh, no. You are at the right place. He does live here."

    a "But he is not one of my guests. In fact, he is my boss, sort of."

    scene rcsj_a13 with tstmgr

    b "Your boss? He owns this place?"

    a "Indeed. He is the owner of this house."

    b "So he is now running a B&B house? That's... something beyond my expectations."

    scene rcsj_a12 with tstmgr

    b "... ... ... ..."

    b "Thank you for telling me that."

    scene rcsj_a14 with tstmgr

    a "You are welcome. Would you like to come inside and wait for him? He is about to finish his shower."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    scene rcsj_a15 with tstmgr

    narrator "Vera and Senning entered the living room together."

    scene rcsj_a16 with tstmgr

    a "Well..."

    a " I'm Vera, [P.name]'s... assistant. It's nice to meet you."

    scene rcsj_a17 with tstmgr

    b "Nice to meet you too, Miss Vera. I am Senning, an international student from China."

    narrator "Miss Vera? That sounds weird. Vera is my given name, not my surname. Maybe she's just being polite or traditional..."

    narrator "It was actually a cute grammar mistake. I kinda like the name \"Miss Vera.\""

    scene rcsj_a18 with tstmgr

    a "I had some Chinese lessons back in high school. Senning means \"forest\" in Chinese, right?"

    scene rcsj_a19 with tstmgr

    b "You surprised me, Miss Vera. You are the first one I've met in this country who knows the Chinese language."

    b "And your interpretation of my name is quite close. In fact, the full meaning of my name is \"lemon in the forest.\""

    a "Wow, such a poetic name you have."

    b "Thank you."

    scene rcsj_a17 with tstmgr

    b "If you don't mind, Miss Vera, I have a question."

    a "Please say it."

    b "You just said you are his assistant, so what do you do for work exactly?"

    scene rcsj_a16 with tstmgr

    a "Nothing but cleaning, cooking, and checking in guests when I have time. I'm basically a housekeeper."

    scene rcsj_a21 with tstmgr

    b "That sounds like a lot of work."

    a "Yeah, but I like this job, so no big deal."

    b "That's... good to hear."

    b "So, does [P.name] live with the guests?"

    a "Yes, but not exactly. All the guest bedrooms are on the ground floor. [P.name] and I are living upstairs."

    scene rcsj_a22 with tstmgr

    b "What? You live here, too? You... You and [P.name], live together?"

    scene rcsj_a20 with tstmgr

    a "Eh... yes?"

    b "... ... ... ..."

    a "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "The awkward silence..."

    narrator "This Chinese girl seems to care about [P.name] very much. I wonder what her relationship with him is. Is she his girlfriend? I don't dare to ask."

    narrator "If they really are a couple, perhaps I should speak less. I don't want her to take me as her rival in love or something."

    narrator "But... why am I feeling a little upset When I know that she might be [P.name]'s girlfriend... ..."

    b "I think, I, I should probably go."

    a "You don't want to wait for him?"

    scene rcsj_a17 with tstmgr

    b "No, no. I have a class in an hour. I can't stay long."

    b "I will leave my notebook here, please hand it to him. It's so nice to meet you, Miss Vera."

    a "Nice to meet you too..."

    scene void with tstmgr

    narrator "She left in a hurry."

    narrator "A few minutes later, [P.name] came out from the bathroom."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player " What's the matter?"

    scene rcsj_a25 with tstmgr

    a "A Chinese girl was there a few minutes ago. She left her notebook to you."

    player "Oh, that must be Senning. How do you like her?"

    a "She is adorable."

    player "But you don't look so well. Did you two have an argument?"

    scene rcsj_a26 with tstmgr

    a "No, it's not about her..."

    a "Is she your girlfriend?"

    player "What?"

    player "No, but she is one of the best friends I have in college."

    player "Why do you ask? Did she have any action that makes you feel \"she loves me\"?"

    scene rcsj_a24 with tstmgr

    a "I am not sure. But she definitely cares about you very much."

    a "I was just hoping... she would not take me as her rival if she really loves you."

    player "Ha!"

    scene rcsj_a27 with tstmgr

    a " What's that \"Ha!\" for? Why do you look excited?"

    player "It's fun to imagine two beauties like you and Senning falling in love with the same dude and getting jealous at each other. It's just like a Japanese harem galgame."

    scene rcsj_a28 with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "Unbelievable. You must be crazy."

    scene rcsj_a26 with tstmgr

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    a "(Japanese harem galgame? What kind of game is that?)"
