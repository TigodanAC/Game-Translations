    narrator "What a sunny weekend! I should ask Senning out for another beach trip."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    player "(Speaking on the phone) Hello, Senning, do you have time today?"

    b "Today? I don't have many things to do. What's your plan?"

    player "Let's go to beeeeeeeach!"

    player "I want to see you with a swiiiiiiiiiiimsuit on again!"

    b "You know you sound like a freak, right?"

    player "Oh, eh, I am just kinda excited."

    player "Anyway, you coming? Today is really a good day for a beach trip."

    b "... ... ... ..."

    b "Alright, let's go."

    player "Awesome! I'll go pick you up."

    narrator "I drove to her apartment and picked her up, then we went to the beach together."

    narrator "The weather is nice today with sunshine and moderate temperature. And there was no traffic problem at all. Everything seems wonderful."

    player "Don't you want to go swimming?"

    scene zmxd_beach_b2 with tstmgr

    b "I can't swim. I always want to learn it, but I was scared every time when I got into the water."

    player "Perhaps it was because you did not have a good teacher?"

    b "Maybe you are right."

    scene zmxd_beach_b1 with tstmgr

    b "So... are you willing to teach me?"

    player "Well, I really would like to teach you that, but I'm not a good swimmer, either."

    player "But I do know a girl who is good at swimming. I can introduce her to you someday. I'm sure she would be willing to teach you."

    b "Really? That will be great."

    narrator "The girl I was talking about is Теодора. Although she always seems cold to me, she is actually friendly to everyone else. Maybe I should set a time to let them meet once."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    b "Let's have a race. Whoever reaches the tree over there shall win, and the loser has to accept one request from the winner."

    narrator "Wait, what?"

    scene zmxd_beach_b4 with tstmgr

    narrator "She suddenly started running to that tree right after she finished her words. That's a false start!"

    narrator "Cheater! How could she do that!"

    narrator "Wait..."

    narrator "Did she just mention that the loser has to accept one request from the winner?"

    narrator "Which means..."

    narrator "If I win, I can make her do one thing I want?"

    narrator "God, I have to win this!"

    narrator "But I suddenly start to wonder what she is going to request me for if she wins this match."

    narrator "Should I catch her up or should I just let her win?"

            narrator "I burst out like a rocket, and got close to her in a single flash. I never thought I can run so fast."

            scene zmxd_beach_b6 with tstmgr

            player "Caught you."

            b "Ah? How did you......"

            b "Are you a superhero or something? You ran like The Flash himself."

            player "So, I win, right?"

            b "... ... ... ..."

            b "Why are you cuddling me from behind?"

            player "You said the loser has to obey one request that the winner asks. Well, my request is to let you be my girlfriend for one minute."

            scene zmxd_beach_b8 with tstmgr

            b "One minute girlfriend?"

            b "Such a childish wish. Are you playing a play-house game right now?"

            player "You can say whatever you want, but you have to obey the rules set by yourself."

            b "... ... ... ..."

            b "Alright, fine."

            b "I will be your girlfriend for 60 seconds. Take your time, but don't do anything strange."

            scene zmxd_beach_b9 with tstmgr

            narrator "Great, so now I can keep her body in my arms for an entire minute."

            narrator "Under this circumstance, the “one-minute-girlfriend” request is undoubtedly a perfect request. It is erotic enough, but it does not cross the line yet. What's even more important is, it's a romantic request, not a dirty one."

            narrator "Think about it. If I straightly ask her for “cuddling you from behind for one minute,\" it would make me sound like nothing but a dirty goat. She would not like it for sure."

            narrator "But now with this “one-minute girlfriend” request, I can achieve my goal without offending her. Hail to the art of language."

            narrator "My hands surrounded her flat belly like holding a pillow. I can smell her intoxicating scent behind her ears. It feels so wonderful."

            narrator "... ... ... ..."

            b "Ho much time left?"

            player "Still 20 seconds to go."

            narrator "Time flies so fast when one is enjoying it. It would be so nice if she is really my girlfriend, so I could enjoy this moment as long as I want."

            narrator "Well, I don't know who this guy is, but I truly appreciate his appearance."

            b "We are not really... ..."

            player "Alright, we agreed. You can take a photo of us."

            player "But we need to have a copy of it."

            "Photographer" "Of course, sure thing. I can even pay you some money if you want."
