    "And Theodora was surrounded by three guys."



    scene c_daily6_2 with tstmgr

    "I don’t really know their names. This is a big company so they might work on different floors. I bet Theodora doesn’t know their names, either. After all, she is only a departmental manager."



    "I saw these three guys putting their hands and arms on Theodora’s body and pretending like they were forced by the crowds."



    "But their satisfied faces have sold them out. Shit, these jerks."



    "Theodora looked a little uncomfortable. She must have realized something, but it seemed like she was going to endure them in silence."



    "What should I do?"
