    "This is my first day in college. The campus is bigger than I thought and it is even more beautiful than it is in the pictures. Hah, I think my college life is going to be great!"



    "*Phone Ringing* Dudududu~~~ Dudududu~~~~ Dudududu~~~~~"



    player "Hmm... a call from Aunt Элиза. I haven’t seen her for a year! I miss her so much!"



    player "She and Айрин... ... and Theo... ..."



    player "(Picking up the call) Hi, auntie!"



    e "Hello, [P]~ How is your first day in college?"



    player "It is great! I can’t wait to meet some new friends!"



    e "It’s so good to hear that~ Will you come to my house for dinner tonight? It has been a year~"



    player "Oh, sure, I’d love to."



    e "Айрин will be so happy about this. See you later~"



    player "Bye, Aunt Элиза."



    "I hung up the phone and took a look at the time. It was nearly 3pm, I think I should go back to my dorm and change a shirt before I go to Aunt Элиза’s house."

    "???" "(Whispering) Excuse... me..."



    player "Emm?"



    scene b_daily15_2 with tstmgr

    "I turned around and saw a girl standing beside me."



    scene b_daily15_3 with tstmgr

    "???" "(Whispering in an even lighter voice) Can you... eh... tell me... eh... the way to... to... ..."



    "Her voice is so quiet and her English is broken... She must be an international student who just came to this country. It will be a challenge to understand what she says."



    "But... nevermind, I like to help people."



    player "Can you please say it again?"



    scene b_daily15_4 with tstmgr

    "???" "Kir... Kirk Hall. The way to... the Kirk Hall... please tell me... ..."



    "She seemed like a very shy girl. It must be tough for her to live and study in this foreign country alone."



    player "Kirk Hall? Hmmm... I really like to help, but sorry, I don’t know where it locates either. I am a freshman just like you."



    scene b_daily15_5 with tstmgr

    "???" "Ah?... ... Fresh... meat?... ..."



    "???" "I... ... don’t... ..."



    player "You... you didn’t understand what I said, right?"



    player "Sigh... Alright then..."



    scene b_daily15_6 with tstmgr

    "I suddenly took her hand and smiled. She groaned out with surprise and her face turned extremely red in less than a second."



    b "Yahhh!... ... ... ..."



    player "Let’s go find the hall together! Take this as a campus adventure! Do you like this idea?"



    scene b_daily15_7 with tstmgr

    "???" "Find... together? Oh... okay... ..."



    player "Ha! I’m glad that you understood this! What’s your name?"



    scene b_daily15_8 with tstmgr

    "???" "My name is... Сеннин."



    player "Сеннин, I like that name~ I mean, it is easy to pronounce. You can call me [P] if you like."

    b "(Murmuring and repeating) [P]... ... [P]... ..."



    scene b_daily15_8 with tstmgr

    b "It’s nice to meet you, [P]..."



    player "It’s nice to meet you, too. Now let’s go for the adventure!"

    player "You know, you have really changed a lot since the first time we met."



    scene b_daily15_11 with tstmgr

    b "The first time we met?"



    b "Oh, I remembered. I was lost and you were the only one willing to help me."



    scene b_daily15_12 with tstmgr

    b "And then we spent the entire afternoon on blind wandering, like two chickens with heads off."



    player "But we did find that building at last, right?"



    b "And I missed two classes for that."



    scene b_daily15_13 with tstmgr

    player "What? You didn’t tell me about that. You didn’t seem to be in a hurry at all."



    scene b_daily15_14 with tstmgr

    b "I... ... ... ..."



    scene b_daily15_15 with tstmgr

    b "I was kind of... enjoying it to walk with you like that... ..."



    b "I mean, you acted like a handsome prince-like guy from a Korean TV series. No 18-year-old girl can reject you in that situation..."



    scene b_daily15_16 with tstmgr

    player "Really? Did you start to like me since then?"



    b "Sort of... ..."
