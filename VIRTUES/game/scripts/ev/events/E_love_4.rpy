    scene e_love_4_13 with tstmgr

    d "It's too sexy! People are all watching you."



    scene e_love_4_14 with tstmgr

    e "That’s the reason why we women wear bikinis on the beach. The more attention we get the better~"

    "But I was not in the mood at all. I was worried about Aunt Elisa."



    "This beach trip is supposed to make her feel less lonely, but turned out she was still left alone. This is... not right."

    d "[P]? Where are you going?"

    "Man A" "Yo, hot lady. Are you here alone?"



    e "Why do you want to know?"



    "Man A" "Well, you know, you are so marvelous and I was attracted by you the first second I saw you. I thought maybe we can make friends and you know, have some fun together?"

    "The guy walked away as I approached."



    scene e_love_4_25 with tstmgr

    e "Did you see that, [P]? Someone just tried to accost me, a 40-year-old old woman. That was quite an accomplishment."



    player "You are absolutely charming as you used to be, Aunt Elisa."



    e "Oww~ sweetie..."



    scene e_love_4_26 with tstmgr

    scene e_love_4_27 with tstmgr

    "I sat down beside her legs."



    e "You don’t look so good. Did you stay up late last night?"



    scene e_love_4_28 with tstmgr

    player "Eh... yeah. Actually, I couldn’t sleep before 3am for quite a while. There are just so many things I have to deal with every day."



    e "You must be really tired."



    scene e_love_4_29 with tstmgr

    e "You can rest your head on my lap if you want... ..."



    player "Aunt Elisa... ..."



    scene e_love_4_31 with tstmgr

    "How can I refuse an offer like that? I stared at that pair of long naked legs for a few seconds, and then put my head on it without hesitation."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "But... ..."



    scene e_love_4_32 with tstmgr

    e "Oh... sorry, I didn’t think of that. You must be very uncomfortable keeping this position."



    player "Ehhhh... ..."



    scene e_love_4_33 with tstmgr

    "She is right. It indeed isn’t a good position. This chair is just too small for 2 people."



    "But I don’t really care about it because..."



    scene e_love_4_34 with tstmgr

    "What I am seeing right now is just splendid. Those tits, damn... ..."



    scene e_love_4_32 with tstmgr

    e "I can’t let you keep this position. It’s bad for your spine. Now sit up~"



    player "What? But... ..."



    scene e_love_4_35 with tstmgr

    e "Don’t worry, I just thought of a better position..."



    e "And a better pillow for you as well."



    scene e_love_4_36 with tstmgr

    player "What are you talking about, Aunt Elisa?"



    e "I’m talking about... ..."



    scene e_love_4_37 with tstmgr

    e "This... ... ... ..."



    player "!!!!!!!"



    e "You can rest your head here, on my chest."



    "A breast pillow? Wow... this is really something new. I never saw it elsewhere before, not even in the porns. How did she come up with such a genius idea?"



    player "Can I... really do that?"



    e "Of course~ Don’t think too much, just come to me and relax yourself."



    player "Aunt Elisa... ..."



    scene e_love_4_38 with tstmgr

    "I carefully set my head on her breasts. Oh my... this is definitely the best pillow in this world."



    "The extreme softness, the wonderful elasticity, and Aunt Elisa’s good-smelling body scent combined together. No man can ever resist this..."



    scene e_love_4_39 with tstmgr

    player "Aunt Elisa... This feels so great~"



    e "Shh... Shh... Now close your eyes and sleep, honey."



    player "Okay... ..."



    "Her words seemed to have magic that made me feel tired... No, it’s not because of her words, it’s because of this pillow. This pillow is just so comfortable that it gave me the urge to sleep the first second my head lay on it."



    player "Aunt Elisa... ..."



    scene e_love_4_40 with tstmgr

    "I turned my head a little and kissed her left breast unconsciously."



    e "(Ohhh~~~ I always want someone to caress me with kisses like this...)"



    e "(My body... feels so hot...)"



    player "Zzzz... Zzz... Zzzz... Zzz... ..."
