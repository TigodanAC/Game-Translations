    b "You know, I actually like to be with the present you more."

    player "What do you mean by \"the present me\"?"

    b "Emm... The you with no money in the pocket."

    player "Is this some sort of comfort? It doesn't help at all..."

    b "But I really mean it."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "Why is that?"

    b "Emm... the old you always want to use money to solve everything. But now, you would hesitate even for a 15-dollar ice cream, just like a normal person would be."

    player "Stop, please, for God's sake, just stop."

    b "What can I make up for you then?"

    player "There is nothing you can do to fix my broken heart."

    player "(Turning around) Farewell, I'm going to die for a while."

    narrator "Well, that is only a joke. I mean, \"die for a while\" doesn't make any sense at all, right?"

    narrator "Honestly, I don't really feel any upset since I know that my life will be back to what it used to be one day in the future. But it seems fun to pretend as a heartbroken man to joke her around."

    scene b_love3_5 with tstmgr

    narrator "I can smell her good scent. God, this is so enchanting. Now I feel like my life is fulfilled with hope."

    narrator "In normal situations, if a girl puts her breasts against my back, I would definitely feel some sexual desire."

    narrator "But what happens now has nothing to do with sex. Senning's hug gives me nothing but a feeling of love."

    narrator "I would like to make time stop if it's possible."

    scene b_love3_6 with tstmgr

    narrator "We now look just like a loving couple. I bet people will be jealous if they see us."
