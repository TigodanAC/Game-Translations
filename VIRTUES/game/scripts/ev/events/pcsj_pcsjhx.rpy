    narrator "We came to a restaurant near campus and had a good meal."

    narrator "Until..."

    "Server" "Sorry, sir. Your credit card is invalid. Would you like to use another card?"

    player "(Oh, shit. I forgot I can't use my dad's credit cards anymore)."

    narrator "I turned to Сеннин."

    player "Сеннин... I am out of money, would you please...?"

    scene b_school_restaurant_normal with tstmgr

    b "Oh, don't bother it. I will buy you this lunch."

    player "Thank you very much..."

    b "But this is so rare to see. Did your dad stop supporting you?"

    player "Eh... Well..."

    narrator "I told her everything."

    b "Oh my Gods. I'm so sorry to hear this, [P.name]. You must be having a very tough time."

    player "Well, it felt terrible in the beginning, but now I am getting better."

    player "It is just a temporary situation. Everything will be back to normal in the future."

    b "So what are you planning to do now?"

    player "I have found two jobs. So don't worry, I can take care of myself."

    scene wsdg_a3 with tstmgr

    narrator "I came to Вера's workplace to take her home as usual."

    scene a_pcsj_normal with tstmgr

    narrator "When I got there, I saw she was already waiting for me."

    narrator "During these days, I almost come and pick her up every time after she gets off work at night. Both she and I have already got used to it."

    a "You are late today. I've been waiting for 10 minutes."

    player "Ah, sorry. I didn't drive today, so it took me longer to get here."

    a "Why didn't you drive?"

    player "I parked my car in the school. Well, now I am not able to drive it as often as before."

    scene a_pcsj_surprise with tstmgr

    a "What happened?"

    player "I went broke. Now I can't even afford my car's gas fee."

    a "Are you serious?"

    player "Yes. My dad was arrested by the police, and his personal property has been frozen. Now I have to struggle for a living, just like you. This situation may last for one year or more."

    a "Wait, I still don't get it."

    a "You mean, right now I am probably richer than you?"

    player "If you have more than 20 bucks in your pocket, then yes, you are the wealthiest dude between the two of us."

    scene a_pcsj_smile with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    a "Excuse me, I know I am supposed to feel sorry for you right now, but..."

    a "It actually feels great to know that I am richer than you."

    player "Ha, laugh as you want, woman. Don't mind me."

    player "And don't worry, you can still stay in that house. My dad had already transferred the ownership of that house to me. Now that house and my car are all my properties left."

    player "In fact, since now I cannot afford to live in the hotel anymore, I am planning to move into that house, too. Do you mind having a new housemate?"

    scene a_pcsj_surprise with tstmgr

    a "You and me, live together?"

    scene a_pcsj_frown with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    player "I know you may not like this idea, but..."

    scene a_pcsj_normal with tstmgr

    a "No... I'm okay with it..."

    a "Of course you can move into your own house. You have every right to do that."

    narrator "I am quite surprised. I thought she would refuse to stay in the same house with me after what happened the other night."

    player "Alright, thanks for your understanding. And don't worry, I'll find a way to deal with the land tax and utility fees myself."

    a "You know, I can pay you an amount of rent every month. It may not be much, but I just want to help."

    player "No need, Вера. I have already found two jobs that can provide me enough income to take care of those payments."

    a "I see... ..."

    player "I had promised you that I won't charge you for anything, Вера, and I intend to keep that promise."

    a "... ... ... ..."

    scene a_pcsj_smile with tstmgr

    a "Thank you."

    player "But I have to admit it is a little bit too extravagant for the two of us living in such a big house now."

    a "... ... ... ..."

    scene a_pcsj_surprise with tstmgr



    a "What if... perhaps..."

    a "Nevermind, forget it."

    player " What's on your mind?"

    a "Eh, I'm just thinking... ..."

    a "Have you ever thought about using that house to make money?"

    player "What do you mean?"

    a "That house has 5 available bedrooms, and they are all well decorated... ..."

    a "If you start a B&B service there, I'm sure it will be popular. It may be a good way to increase your income."

    player "!!!"

    narrator "I never realized that this girl in front of me has such a sharp business mind."

    narrator "I mean, God, I am one of the best financial-major students in our college. But now a country girl who never went to college is telling me about a business opportunity I never realized. I should be ashamed."

    player "Вера, you are truly a genius!"

    a "(Surprising) It can really work?"

    player "Theoretically, yes."

    player "Let's do this together. I have nothing else to lose, so why don't give it a try? It could be the start of our business career."

    player "I am going to borrow some money from friends and redecorate the house a little bit. I'll try to set it up as soon as possible."

    scene a_pcsj_frown with tstmgr

    a "But... I don't think I should stay there anymore. If you start a B&B service in your house, then each bedroom will be an essential income source for you. I shouldn't just take one of them for free."

    player "Don't be silly. I need you to help me manage the house. I am now formally inviting you to be my... my assistant. I won't be able to pay you any actual wage yet, but I'll allow you to take one bedroom as a reward."

    scene a_pcsj_surprise with tstmgr

    a "Ah... ... ... ..."

    scene a_pcsj_frown with tstmgr

    a "But I have three jobs to do every day. I probably don't have enough time to help you."

    player "And just as I said, I won't pay you any actual wage, either. It's fair, isn't it?"

    player "You can just take it as a part-time job and help me when you have time."

    scene a_pcsj_normal with tstmgr

    a "... ... ... ..."

    scene a_pcsj_smile with tstmgr

    a "Alright, I'll take the job. Thank you."

    player "Great."

    player "I will move into that house tomorrow. After that, I will go prepare the paperwork and register our house on the B&B website. Hopefully, we can start this business in two to three weeks."

    scene a_pcsj_normal with tstmgr

    a "(Repeating in a little voice) \"Our\" house... ..."

    player "Did you say anything?"

    scene a_pcsj_smile with tstmgr

    a "Oh, eh, I was saying that I... I will help you with your move tomorrow afternoon."

    player "Thank you. That'll be nice."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "After that, I walked Вера home. We discussed the future of our B&B business all the way home with great enthusiasm. It feels wonderful to prepare my own career for the first time in my life."

    narrator "My first business partner is a country girl? Man... life is so strange."
