    "Later this afternoon, Теодора took me to a half-abandoned lumber room."



    scene c_daily9_1 with tstmgr

    player "So... what are we looking for?"



    scene c_daily9_2 with tstmgr

    c "Some ancient account books that my mom wants."



    player "But why you need me here?"



    player "I am not your secretary..."



    scene c_daily9_3 with tstmgr

    c "You know, I was actually thinking of promoting you as my secretary."



    player "What? For real?"



    c "I’ll talk to my mom, but don’t expect any raise in your wage. You are still only a part-time employee."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Why are you so grudging?"



    scene void with tstmgr

    "Suddenly, we heard a sound of footsteps."



    scene c_daily9_4 with tstmgr

    c "Emm?"



    c "Strange. How would anyone come here during working hours?"



    player "Eh, maybe someone is looking for some ancient documents too, just like us."



    scene c_daily9_5 with tstmgr

    c "You don’t know much about the management, do you?"



    c "This room is the only room on this floor that has no cameras, which means it is a wonderful site to slack off."



    c "I bet this person is here to take a cigarette break."



    scene c_daily9_6 with tstmgr

    c "We should hide somewhere and observe. I want to catch this person red-handed."



    player "Eh, but there is no place to hide."



    player "Unless... ..."



    scene c_daily9_7 with tstmgr

    "I looked in the direction of a big empty cabinet."



    c "... ... ... ..."



    c "You must be kidding me... ..."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "... ... ... ..."



    "A few moments later."



    scene c_daily9_8 with tstmgr

    c "This place... is too damn small..."



    c "What is that hard thing clinging to my butt?"



    player "Ehh... ... ... ..."



    scene c_daily9_9 with tstmgr

    c "Wait, are you having an erection?"



    player "Sorry..."



    c "I can’t believe it!"

    scene c_daily9_11 with tstmgr

    "Suddenly, the door of the lumber room was opened. Two people came inside. One man, one woman."



    player "So there are two of them, hah."



    c "Quiet."



    "I recognized that woman. She is Sonia, a senior accountant. She is quite popular in the company. Everyone seems to be her friend."



    "As for the guy... I don’t know his name, probably something starts with a ‘B’. Bill? Brandon? I don’t know. I never paid any attention to my male colleagues."



    scene c_daily9_12 with tstmgr

    c "Sonia and Bale, huh."



    "Oh, okay, Bale."



    c "Seems like they are secret lovers. Interesting..."



    scene c_daily9_13 with tstmgr

    "Bale" "What if someone finds us?"



    "Sonia" "Relax, this room has been abandoned for years. No one would come here at work except couples that are looking for a place to have a bang, just like us."



    scene c_daily9_14 with tstmgr

    c "... ... ... ..."



    player "What?"



    c "Is your penis... getting bigger?"



    player "Ehh... sorry. It’s not something I can control."



    scene c_daily9_15 with tstmgr

    "Sonia" "Hurry up, I can’t wait any longer. I want you to fill me with your big cock right now!"



    scene c_daily9_16 with tstmgr

    "Bale" "Shit, come here, bitch."



    "Sonia" "Yes, yes, big cock! Fuck me, don’t stop~~"



    scene c_daily9_12 with tstmgr

    c "... ... ... ..."



    c "I didn’t know Sonia has such an erotic face."



    scene c_daily9_17 with tstmgr

    "Bale" "Tell me, how many men have you seduced in this company?"



    "Sonia" "Twelve... ..."



    scene c_daily9_18 with tstmgr

    "Bale" "Shit, you are a helpless whore!"



    "Sonia" "Yes, yes, I am a whore. Now punish me, punish me harder with your mighty cock!"



    scene c_daily9_12 with tstmgr

    player "Oh my... ... This is magnificent."



    scene c_daily9_19 with tstmgr

    c "... ... ... ..."



    scene c_daily9_20 with tstmgr

    player "Ouch, why did you step on my foot?"



    scene c_daily9_18 with tstmgr

    "Bale" "So tell me, bitch, who’s your next target?"



    "Sonia" "That... that handsome new guy, [P]."



    "Sonia" "I have put my eyes on him for some time..."



    scene c_daily9_19 with tstmgr

    player "Wow... ..."



    player "I am flattered."



    scene c_daily9_20 with tstmgr

    player "Ouch, why did you step on me again?"



    scene c_daily9_18 with tstmgr

    "Bale" "What? Shit, don’t you know that dude is Теодора Shinyrost’s boyfriend?"



    "Bale" "That bitch will tear you apart if she finds out."



    scene c_daily9_21 with tstmgr

    "Sonia" "She will never know... ..."



    scene c_daily9_22 with tstmgr

    c "That disgusting son of a bitch. I’ll make sure she receives her pink slip by the end of today."



    player "Isn't it weird to call a woman ‘son of a bitch’?"



    c "... ... ... ..."



    scene c_daily9_23 with tstmgr

    player "Ouch! Really? Again?!"



    scene c_daily9_24 with tstmgr

    "Sonia" "Wait, what was that voice?"



    "Bale" "Ah? I didn’t hear a thing."



    "Bale" "Let’s keep it going. I was just about to hit the point."



    scene c_daily9_25 with tstmgr

    "Sonia" "Stop, stop, you dickhead. Someone is near. We need to get out of here as soon as we can."



    "Bale" "Wait, are you serious?"



    "Bale" "But... ..."



    "Bale" "Fine, you are right. We should be super careful."

    scene c_daily9_26 with tstmgr

    c "That bitch, I won’t let her get away easily... ..."



    player "Why were you so mad at her?"
