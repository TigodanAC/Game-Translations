    "Late night, in my hotel room, I was lying on the bed and letting my mind wander... ..."



    "... ... ... ..."



    "When will I eventually find my true love?"



    "Сеннин’s picture suddenly came up in my head."



    scene d2_5_1 with tstmgr

    "Сеннин, that lovely long-hair girl... ... We are close friends and she seems to like me. Should I go after her?"



    "Yeah, I think I should go after her and I should do it quickly. She has a lot of pursuers. I’d better hurry or someone else may take the chance."



    "But... ... ... ..."



    scene d2_5_2 with tstmgr

    "Can I really let go of Теодора?"



    "That sexy silver-hair girl... ... Although sometimes she is cold and mean, she still has a soft side and I just saw it today. That was... amazing... ..."



    "No... no... I can’t just let go of her."



    "Sigh... ... It will be so great if I can have them both... ..."



    "Hmmmm... ... ... ..."



    "Have them... both?"



    "Like having a harem? But... is it even possible?"



    "Sigh... I guess I can achieve that in my dream tonight... ... ... ..."

    "Suddenly, my phone started ringing."



    player "Hmmmmm? Who is this?"



    "Jake" "Hey my man, it’s me, Jake. I'm holding a party tomorrow night at Citidal Nightclub. Do you wanna come?"



    "Jake, a good friend of mine."



    "Tomorrow night? Well, I do have time tomorrow."



    player "Fine, I will be there."



    "Jake" "Good, see you there."



    player "See ya."



    "... ... ... ..."



    "Citidal Nightclub is the coolest club in this city and it is the best place to meet girls. You can find all kinds of beauties there."



    "Maybe tomorrow I can find myself another wonderful one-night-stand there? That will be a good way to solve my sex desire so I won’t have those mad pictures about harem things in my head again."



    "Yeah... that sounds good..."



    "Anyway, I'd better go to bed for now. Let's see what will happen tomorrow."



    "... ... ... ..."
