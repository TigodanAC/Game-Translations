    "Although now I have 7 lovely wives, I still come to Posia’s store at least once a week. I bring her the superhero comic books, she repays me with free ‘services’, it is a win-win deal."



    "I don’t know why she wants those comics. She said it was a request from a relative of hers. That answer does not solve the doubts in my mind, but... ... whatever, it is not important."



    "I mean, they are just comic books, not something dangerous. There is nothing to worry about. If she doesn’t want to tell me, fine, I don’t care."



    "But... there is one thing about her I always want to know... ..."



    player "After all these years, I still don’t know exactly why you call me ‘the chosen one’."



    scene trailor_final_1 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Hah? You are still wondering about that?"



    player "I mean, I’m chosen by whom? You? Gods?"



    scene trailor_final_2 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "The great destiny. It’s always about the great destiny."



    player "Seriously, Posia, when the first time we met, you said you were not a neurotic fortuneteller from a carnival who fools the kids for a living and I believed that. But now... damn, I don’t know."



    scene trailor_final_3 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "You don't understand me because you didn’t see what I saw. My sister has shown me the vastness of the universe, the knowledge from other worlds, and the flow of the great destiny."



    player "Okay, now it began to sound even creepier... ..."



    scene trailor_final_4 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Whatever, just forget what I said."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Destiny... ... so you think it is fate that determines our life?"



    "Posia" "The destiny only provides us the opportunity, we have to catch the opportunity ourselves."



    scene trailor_final_5 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "For example, the great destiny showed how it favors you by bringing seven girls to you, but it depends on you to decide what to do with them. Maybe you decided to be normal friends with them, maybe you chose to have one-night romances with them, or maybe you guys eventually become enemies, who knows."



    player "Ha~ then I guess I’m pretty good at catching opportunities~"



    scene trailor_final_6 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Uh-huh~"



    player "So... is there more people like me out there? The chosen ones?"



    "Posia" "This universe is bigger than you think. There must be others like you who are favored by the great destiny, in this world or another."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Alright, forget about it. Do you want to tell me about the weird nerdy sister of yours who loves superhero comics but doesn’t even dare to buy them herself?"



    scene trailor_final_7 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Hmmmmmm... ... It is not like that, but sorry, I cannot reveal her information~"



    scene trailor_final_8 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Maybe you will soon meet her yourself, who knows~"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "(Now I began to think that ‘sister’ is just an imaginary friend of hers. I really think she needs to see a doctor... ...)"



    "*Phone ringing* Dududududu~~~ Dudududu~~~~"



    player "Hmmmm?"



    player "Oh, Irene is calling me. The girls just finished shopping and I need to drive them home~"



    scene trailor_final_9 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Okay then, just go enjoy your harem life, the chosen one~"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Do you want to join us for dinner?"



    scene trailor_final_10 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Me? No, I have no interest in getting along with your wives."



    scene trailor_final_11 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Remember to bring me more superhero comic books when you come back~"



    player "I will... ..."



    player "Bye, Posia."



    scene trailor_final_12 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Uh-huh~"
