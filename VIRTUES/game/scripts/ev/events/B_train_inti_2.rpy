            "Lady Minna" "But thanks to you, now I don’t have that worry anymore. I’m sure She will become a real woman after this relationship with you, a woman with a bigger heart and a stronger mind."

            "However, she was not sensitive to my body scent anymore. I guess that meant I have lost her love. The disappointment is like a knife that cuts off her attachment to me."

            "We didn’t do any... intimate activity either. I once tried to kiss her but she shrank away. I apologized to her the next day and she accepted it with politeness, as normal friends would do."
