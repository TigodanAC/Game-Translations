    "I am very concerned about Aunt Elisa recently."



    "Irene is going to graduate from highschool and she may eventually move out of this mansion. By that time Aunt Elisa will be the only one who lives in that place."



    "That will be... tragic, isn’t it? A lonely woman in a big empty house. It's gonna be so hard for her."



    "I wonder why she stays single for so many years. Damn, I wish I am 10 years older so I can go pursue her rightly."



    scene e_daily4_1 with tstmgr

    player "Aunt Elisa, can I ask you a question?"



    scene e_daily4_2 with tstmgr

    e "Yeah, of course."



    player "It has been 15 years since you got divorced. I can feel your loneliness growing every time when I see you."



    scene e_daily4_3 with tstmgr

    e "Oh... ... ... ..."



    e "Is it that obvious?"



    player "So... why didn’t you get married again? There must be a lot of men trying to pursue you."



    e "Why... would you want to know that?"



    player "I am worried about you..."



    e "Ohh... sweetie... ..."



    e "Okay, I will tell you the truth."



    scene e_daily4_4 with tstmgr

    e "Firstly, I don’t trust any man who tries to get along with me. I’m afraid that they would love my money more than they would love me."



    "Well... ... that’s reasonable."



    scene e_daily4_5 with tstmgr

    e "And the second thing is... I always felt inferior for myself, so I am afraid to... keep an intimate relationship with a man."



    player "What? No way, you are the most perfect woman I have ever known in my life. You are so beautiful, so gentle, and so... eh, rich. Why on earth would you feel inferior?"



    scene e_daily4_2 with tstmgr

    e "Ohhh... I’m so happy to hear you saying that."



    scene e_daily4_5 with tstmgr

    e "But... actually... I have a physical defect."



    player "Physical... defect?"



    scene e_daily4_3 with tstmgr

    e "It’s not a big deal. You don’t need to worry about me at all."



    player "But... have you gone to see a doctor?"



    e "I haven't. It was a very private problem, so... ..."



    e "I'd rather not talk about it now. Sorry, [P]."



    player "Oh, okay, sorry, Aunt Elisa, I asked too much."



    scene e_daily4_2 with tstmgr

    e "Anyway, thanks for caring, [P]. You are such a sweet young man."



    player "I just want you to be happy, Aunt Elisa. I don’t want you to be alone after Irene goes to college."



    scene e_daily4_3 with tstmgr

    e "I’ll be fine... ..."



    scene e_daily4_6 with tstmgr

    e "Just... remember to stop by and pay me a visit with Theodora when you are free."



    player "Oww, Aunt Elisa..."



    scene e_daily4_7 with tstmgr

    "I suddenly stepped up and hugged her tightly."



    e "Ohhhhh~~"



    e "(Oh my God! His arms are so strong~)"



    scene e_daily4_8 with tstmgr

    e "(And he is pressing my chest so hard... ...)"



    scene e_daily4_7 with tstmgr

    e "I... ... [P]... ..."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "(Oh, shit...)"



    player "(Her giant soft breasts are close against me!)"



    player "(Man... I swear I just wanted to give her a warm little hug. But now things are getting weird...)"



    player "(Wait... ...)"



    player "(There is an amazing scent I can smell on her body... It’s like a milk fragrance that you can smell from every little baby.)"



    player "(It smells... so good...)"

    player "(I can’t help recall that night... ...)"



    scene e_daily4_7 with flashback

    e "[P]?"



    player "Ah? Oh, sorry!"



    scene e_daily4_3 with tstmgr

    player "Sorry, Aunt Elisa. Did I clasp you too hard? I was just trying to... ..."



    e "It’s... nothing..."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    scene e_daily4_9 with tstmgr



    "She looks upset. I think I need to say something right now to make her feel better."



    player "Hey, Aunt Elisa. I think we should hang out together sometime. We can go to the beach, or hold another picnic party."



    scene e_daily4_10 with tstmgr

    e "What? You mean, only the two of us?"



    player "Oh, no, I mean, it will be great if Theodora and Irene can come as well."



    scene e_daily4_9 with tstmgr

    e "Oh... ... ... ..."



    "She looked even more upset for some reason. Did I say something wrong?"



    scene e_daily4_11 with tstmgr

    e "Alright, [P]. I’ll talk to the girls."



    player "Okay... ... ... ..."
