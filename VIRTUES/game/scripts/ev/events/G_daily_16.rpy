    scene g_daily16_1 with dissolve

    "Uno is kneeling at my feet obediently, enjoying my touch like a tame cat."



    g "Purrrrrr~~~ This is always the best part of my day~"



    "Well, it is my best part of the day as well."



    player "Uno, there is a question I've wanted to ask you for a long time... ..."



    scene g_daily16_2 with tstmgr

    g "What is it, master?... ..."



    player "Eh... I know it is kind of your life goal to be a pet and I’m happy to do this roleplay with you too, but I am curious... ... how did you develop such a character?"



    scene g_daily16_3 with tstmgr

    g "Why do you want to know that?~"



    scene g_daily16_4 with tstmgr

    player "You know you mean more than just a pet to me, right? You are the love of my life, I mean, one of the loves of my life, and I want to know more about you..."



    scene g_daily16_5 with tstmgr

    g "Let me think... ..."



    scene g_daily16_6 with tstmgr

    g "My biological parents abandoned me after I was born and I never knew who they were and what they looked like. I grew up in a foster family, but it never felt like a home to me."



    scene g_daily16_7 with tstmgr

    player "Oh honey, I’m so sorry to hear that."



    scene g_daily16_8 with tstmgr

    g "There is no need to feel sorry for me. I didn’t think I was miserable or anything. I didn’t know what it is like to have a family, so I didn’t feel bad for not having it."



    scene g_daily16_9 with tstmgr

    g "But during my years in the foster care, I was desperately curious about the concept of family. I wanted to have a shelter... and someone that I can fully rely on."



    g "That’s when I started to dream to be a pet and find myself an ‘owner’. In my opinion, an ‘owner’ is like a combination of a parent and a lover... which are the things I never had before."



    player "I see... ..."



    scene g_daily16_10 with tstmgr

    g "And I’m so happy that I found you, master~ You are the most perfect owner!"



    scene g_daily16_11 with tstmgr

    player "It’s kinda weird to know that you take me as a half father though, but I can understand that. If that can make you feel more secure, so be it~"



    scene g_daily16_12 with tstmgr

    g "Although I didn’t have a real father in my life, I have found the best choice of father for my future kid~"



    g "Master will be the best father ever!~"



    player "It’s... a little bit too early to think about that now... ..."



    g "But we will have kids, right, master?"



    player "I... I guess so, yes~"



    scene g_daily16_13 with tstmgr

    g "Master~~ master~~ hee hee, love you~~"
