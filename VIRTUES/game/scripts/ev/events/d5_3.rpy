    player "Hi, Jake? Did you find anything useful?"

    "Jake" "Of course I did. I found Vera's neighbor, that Jennifer, bought her some drinks, then she told me everything she knows."

    "Jake" "According to her, that Vera was from a poor countryside family. She came to this city alone last month, trying to make a better life."

    "Jake" "She now has two jobs to do every day, morning at a cafe as a waitress, afternoon at a clothing store as a salesperson. And as far as I know, she has just found another job at Uzi Bar, and she will be there tonight for her first day at work."

    player "What? Why would she go there?"

    "Jake" "Eh, I don't know, man. It may be because of the wage. You know, that pub pays a considerable amount of money to female employees."

    player "I see..."

    narrator "This is not good, because there is a reason for that club offering high wages to girls."

    narrator "I need to do something about it."

    player "Alright, bro, I will be there tonight to check her out. Thank you."

    b "You are just hopeless! I'm leaving."

    player "Hey, let me explain... Damn..."

    narrator "She left angrily."

    narrator "Well, this is Senning. She is like a sheep in most cases, but she would become a lion when she gets angry."

    narrator "I pissed two girls off in the last two days. What a genius I am."

    narrator "Anyway, now the most important thing is to find Vera tonight. And let's see if I can do something to make Senning cool down tomorrow. "
