    g "Hmm? Can I help you?"



    "Man A" "We know who you are. You are Уно, right? That Уно, the rising amateur pornstar."

    "Man A" "Wh... ... what... ..."



    "Man B" "*Asking in a low voice* Shit, do we have anything else that can threaten her with?"



    "Man A" "I... I don’t know... Oh, wait!"



    "Man A" "We have the picture of your uncovered face now. If we post it online, one day your parents and family will eventually find it! Is it okay for you too?"



    scene g_daily11_7 with tstmgr

    "Уно suddenly stiffened at the man’s words..."



    g "My parents?"



    "Man A" "Yeah, your parents! I’m sure they will be so disappointed in you when they find out what a whore you are!"



    "Man A" "But don’t worry, we won’t post it online if you do as we want. Come to room 3504, XXX hotel tonight alone and don’t let your so called master know, will you?"

    "Man B" "What... what is that?"



    scene g_daily11_11 with tstmgr

    g "*Pressing the play button* A recording pen, sirs."



    "Recording pen" "*But don’t worry, we won’t post it online if you do as we want. Come to room 1804, XXX hotel tonight alone and don’t tell others, will you?*"



    "Man A" "Shit... ..."



    scene g_daily11_12 with tstmgr

    g "Now I got the evidence of your threat and your hotel room number. I believe the police can easily find your real name by asking the hotel."



    g "I’ll call the police if you keep harassing me or expose my personal information online, so, do we have a deal now?"
