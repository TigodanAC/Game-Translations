    "??" "Your sleeping face looks ridiculous. Don't be like a baby, get your ass off your bed."



    player "Hmm?!?!..."



    "Ahhhh... ... I hate to be woken by other people. It's like my personal space is getting invaded."



    "I don't even need to open my eyes to see who that is. I live in a luxury hotel suite, and there is only one person who has the key to this room besides me."

    "This woman, Theodora, daughter of ShinyRost Inc's president. ShinyRost is one of the biggest companies in this city."



    "I have known this girl since childhood. She is two years older than me. I had a crush on her when we were in highschool. We were so close during that time that I almost confessed my love to her, but unfortunately it didn't work out at last."



    "After that, our relationship became bad for... hmm... ... no reason."



    "What can you say? I missed my chance and we can’t be back again. This is life."



    "But my dad and her mom actually expect us to get married. They are friends in life and allies in business, and they are happy to further improve their alliance by setting a marriage for their children."



    "Now Theodora is still on my potential-true-love list. I know she is a workaholic with apathy to sex, a cold untouchable woman that no one can really get into her heart, but... she was my first crush and the first crush is always special."

    c "What are you looking at?"



    player "Your tits."



    c "Ha ha, funny... ... ... ..."



    "Although I think I still like her, I always act rudely and obscenely in front of her. It is not the real me, of course. I guess I just want to draw her attention."

    c "I don't have time for this. You need to get up from that bed now. It is already noon."



    player "Why do you care? I don’t have class today. I can sleep as long as I want."



    c "I told you two days ago that a business partner of my mom is holding a pool party this afternoon. I need you to go with me together."



    player "Why do I have to attend a party held by a person I don't even know? You can just go alone."

    c "You really want me to be surrounded by a dozen of half-naked men alone?"



    "She suddenly pulled her dress down for a bit. Her tits were about to burst out."



    player "Shit... What are you doing?..."



    "I am getting an erection."



    scene day2_c5 with tstmgr

    "To be honest, I can't remember how many times I have masturbated while imagining her tits."



    "Those amazing tits... I want to put my hands in that cleavage, I want to stick my dick into it, I want to drown myself in it... ..."



    player "I... ..."



    scene day2_c4 with tstmgr

    c "You really should have a look at your face, little virgin. Now stop bitching around, just get on your clothes and go with me."

    "Sometime later, Theodora and I arrived at the party location, an upscale indoor swimming pool. It would cost a lot of money to book this whole place for an afternoon, whoever hosted it must be a super-rich dude."



    scene day2_c6 with tstmgr

    "Theodora changed her cold face at the first second when we got there. She smiled to the others with politeness and passion, and acted a lot more conversable than when she was with me."



    "She always knows how to use her charm to make the maximum profit. Look at her swimming suit. That is one of the sexiest costumes I have ever seen in my life. She is using it to get an advantageous position when negotiating with people who were stunned at her body."



    "She acts like a dissolute social butterfly, but I know that is not the real her. She was born an actor, now she is just playing her role."



    "She is playing a dangerous game. I have noticed how those men stared at her, like hungry beasts staring at a meal feast. That is why she needs me, her fiance, to be here and keep her out of potential harassment."



    "Ha, these poor guys are all fooled. Theodora is not as adorable as she looks."



    scene day2_c7 with tstmgr

    "Look at what she is doing! She bent over to show off her big breasts and pretended like it was an accident."

    c "You don’t seem very happy."



    player "What should I be happy about? I don't even want to be here. I don't know anyone here, and I didn't even wear my favorite swim trunk."



    c "That's all?"



    player "What else could it be?"

    "Man B" "And there will be a dance party later this evening. Would you like to come, young lady?"



    "Man C" "It will be so great if you show up there. And I’d like to introduce my elder son to you. His name is... ..."
