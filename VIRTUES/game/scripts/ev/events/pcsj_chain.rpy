    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "The rest of the week was uneventful. But things are getting better, I can tell you that."

    narrator "Now my relations with Вера and with Сеннин have been magnificently improved. This is inspiring."

    narrator "I thought my life would be easy like this forever, but I was wrong. On the morning of the next Monday, my life was entirely changed by a phone call."

    narrator "*Phone Ringing* Dududu, dududu, dududu, dududu..."

    narrator "*Phone Ringing* Dududu, dududu, dududu..."

    player "... What happened?"

    player "Who would call so early?"

    player "(Yawning) (Picking up cellphone) Hello? Who is this?"

    e "Hello, [P.name], it's me, Элиза."

    player "Oh, Aunt Элиза, hello there. What's going on?"

    e "I don't know if you have seen the news already..."

    player "Eh... I didn't care about the news lately, is there anything I need to know?"

    e "It's your dad. He is in trouble."

    player "My dad? What kind of trouble?"

    e "He is suspected to manipulate the city council election. The police have arrested him."

    player "Is today April 1st????? Aunt Элиза, it's not funny."

    e "I wasn't joking. It is true. You can go search it on the internet."

    e "His personal property has been temporarily frozen, and he is now being investigated by the government. He won't get paroled during the investigation, and he won't be able to contact you for a fairly long time."

    player "Damn!"

    player "Where is he now? I need to see him."

    e "He is arrested in the Capital City. But don't worry, he will get through this. He has the best lawyers you can find in this country."

    e "And now, you have a more important issue to deal with."

    player "What is even more important than my dad?"

    e "Haven't I told you about your father's personal property has been frozen?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "Oh, shit."

    narrator "I have no jobs, no savings. Every penny I spend is from my dad. If his property is frozen, then..."

    narrator "Now I have become a pauper?"

    e "Your father is a precise man, I don't think the police would find any evidence that can convict him. He is fine."

    e "But you are not. As far as I know, you will lose all your income sources after your dad goes to jail. Am I right?"

    player "Eh... that's right..."

    e "So do you have any plan?"

    player "I, I don't know, Aunt Элиза. I'm in a mess..."

    e "Do you have any savings?"

    player "Eh, no..."

    player "But... Aunt Элиза, you are going to help me, right?"

    e "Of course I am going to help."

    player "Thank you."

    e "Don't thank me so quickly yet. I won't spoil you as your dad did. I can only help you by offering you a job at my company. You will work under Теодора's lead."

    e "You have to work for a living by yourself, and it is also a chance for you to get along with Теодора. She is a prideful girl who only admires the strong. You need to prove yourself to her."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "Is this the only job I can get? "

    e "No, but this is the best job I can offer you."

    player "I, I see."

    player "I'll take the job, Aunt Элиза."

    e "Good, [P.name], don't let me down."

    player "And I have another question..."

    player "Where should I live right now?"

    narrator "If I can't use my dad's money, I won't be able to live in this hotel anymore."

    narrator "It will be great if Aunt Элиза can have me in her mansion. I know she has a lot of empty rooms at her place. And I will be able to live with her and Айрин together. That sounds not bad."

    e "You are a grown man. You ought to fix this problem yourself."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "That's... sad..."

    player "Alright, Aunt Элиза, I get it."

    e "Great. You can come to work start from the next Monday. Теодора will tell you about the detail."

    player " I really appreciate it, Aunt Элиза."

    e "You are half a son to me. I really hope you can overcome this situation."

    e "Oh, and here is another thing."

    e "Besides what I have just offered, I have another job for you, a private job."

    player "What's that, Aunt Элиза? I will accept every opportunity."

    e "It's glad to see you have such a passion."

    e "I want you to be Айрин's private tutor. You know, she doesn't do well in studying. I wish you can help her."

    e "You can come to our house and tutor her every day after she gets home from school, and of course, you'll get paid for that."

    player "I'm very happy to do that. Thanks again, Aunt Элиза."

    e "That's all I have to say, [P.name]. I wish you can stay strong and work out this situation."

    player "I will try my best, Aunt Элиза. I promise."

    e "Goodbye, [P.name]."

    player "Bye, Aunt Элиза."

    narrator "I hung up the phone."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    player "Damn, dad. What have you done?"

    player "Manipulating election? You are truly a fuxking genius!"

    player "what am I supposed to do now? I can't do anything without my dad's money."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "Maybe I can borrow some money from my wealthy friends, and repay them once the bank unfreezes my dad's property?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "But if I do such things, Aunt Элиза and my dad will definitely be disappointed. They seem to expect me to get through this situation by myself."

    player "I think I'll just listen to Aunt Элиза and accept those two jobs. I won't ask friends for borrowing money unless it is the only solution left."

    player "As for the housing..."

    player "I'd better move to the house where Вера is living right now. After all that house is my only estate."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "I don't know if she is okay with me being her housemate."
    narrator "But I think she'll understand."
