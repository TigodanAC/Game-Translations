    "Posia" "As you wish, the chosen one~"



    scene trailer_1_2 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "... ... ... ..."

    "Posia" "Yes, just like that~"



    player "I’m really surprised, Posia. I didn’t know you are a comic lover."



    "Posia" "I am not, but a friend of mine is. I am just trying to prepare her a gift."



    player "Wow, this actually surprised me again. I never knew you have other friends."



    scene trailer_1_5 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Hmmmmmm... ... Technically she cannot be counted as my friend, she is more like my family. We are somehow blood-related."



    "Somehow?"



    player "Okay... ..."



    player "I will help you, but what I can get in return?"



    scene trailer_1_6 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "One time of free service~"



    player "Sounds fair to me. Can I use this free service today?"



    scene trailer_1_7 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "No, you have to bring me the comic books first. A deal is a deal~"

    player "Huh? What do you mean by dimension?"



    player "Wait a minute, are you suggesting that there are multiverses where exist other... chosen ones?"



    scene trailer_1_9 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "do you believe in the existence of multiverses?"

            "Posia" "Then you should understand that there will definitely be people like you in other worlds~"

            player "... ... ... ..."

            player "Why am I getting this feeling that you have actually been to other worlds? Otherwise how could you be so sure about it?"

            player "Shit, why am I getting this feeling that you just don’t care to explain to me the existence of a well-known truth?"

            scene trailer_1_11 with tstmgr

            "Posia" "Haha~ You are just thinking too much~"
