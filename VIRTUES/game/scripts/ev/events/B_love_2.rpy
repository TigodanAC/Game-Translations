    narrator "What should I do on such a beautiful afternoon?"

    narrator "I have no more class today. And there is no assignment due tonight. Now it's time to enjoy my life."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "I think I will just go find Senning. I know she doesn't have classes this afternoon, either."

    narrator "I picked up my phone and called her number."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Du... Du... Du... Du..."

    narrator "No one answers."

    player "Weird..."

    player "Where would she be?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "She always stays at the library when she is free. I'm going to take my chance there."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator " I went to the library."

    scene b_love2_1 with tstmgr

    narrator "As expected, I found her in a corner on the second floor. She is having a nap right now."

    narrator "Wait..."

    player "Hmm... ... ... ..."

    narrator "She has a very special sleeping pose."

    scene b_love2_2 with tstmgr

    narrator "She puts her breast on the table, lowers her head, and falls asleep like this."

    narrator "To be honest, Senning's breasts are not the biggest among the girls I know, but they are still undoubtedly super attractive."

    scene b_love2_3 with tstmgr

    narrator "Her dressing style is conservative. Although the weather is not cold, she still wears this long-sleeved shirt that hides every skin under her neck. But it doesn't matter, she is still sexy when she sleeps like this."

    player "(It looks like she is inducing men into committing crimes on her)."

    player "(What if it's not me, but other people see her like this?)..."

    narrator "I don't know the reason, but I feel bad when I imagine other people may see what I am seeing right now."

    scene b_love2_2 with tstmgr

    player "(I should probably wake her up)."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    scene b_love2_3 with tstmgr

    player "On second thought... I should probably not..."

    player "(Maybe I could... do something to her? I mean, she wouldn't notice a thing)."

    narrator "I came closer to her."

    player "(For example)..."

    player "(I can touch her head)."

    scene b_love2_4 with tstmgr

    narrator "I reached out with a hand and touch her hair softly."

    scene b_love2_5 with tstmgr

    narrator "I can hear her slight snoring, it sounds like baby whimpering."

    narrator "Ah... that is lovely."

    player "(Maybe...)"

    player "(I can do something even more invasive?)"

    player "(But that's not right...)"

            scene b_love2_6 with tstmgr

            narrator "I put out a finger, and then used it to poke one side of her breasts. My finger suddenly felt something soft as a marshmallow."

            narrator "Damn that feels good."

            player "(Damn it, I can't take this anymore)."

            scene b_love2_7 with tstmgr

            narrator "I changed the finger into an entire hand and grabbed her breast."

            narrator "I feel like I am holding a heaven in my hand."

            player "(Hoho, I can do this all day.)"

            narrator "She seemed to be roused by my actions."

            player "(Damn, she is awaking.)"

            narrator "I loosed my hand immediately."

            scene b_love2_5 with tstmgr

            narrator "I don't know why I did this, but I put my hand on her head after loosing it from her breast. Maybe I just didn't enjoy her body enough yet."

            narrator "But no need to worry, this is a safe action. She will only take this as a prank after she wakes."

            b "Em... What happened..."

            b "Why are you standing by my side?"

            b "And touching my head?..."

            narrator "She woke up, but still in an unconscious mode."

            player "You can't blame me on that. You look so cute when sleep."

            scene b_love2_11 with tstmgr

            b "Really?"

            b "... ... ... ..."

            b "Move your hand away. It itches."

            player "I can't. It is attracted by your head."

            b "Is my head a magnet?"

            player "How would anyone say her head is a magnet? You are dumb."

            scene b_love2_12 with tstmgr

            scene b_love2_13 with tstmgr

            narrator "She closed her eyes again and continued to sleep. Maybe she is really tired."

            narrator "I still didn't move my hand away. She seemed to be comfortable with my touching. Sometimes she would even rub against my hand like a kitty."

            narrator "And so my evil thought rose again."

            narrator "Maybe I can raise her shirt up and see what kind of bra she is wearing?"

            narrator "I looked around. This entire building is quiet and empty. No one would notice me."

            scene b_love2_14 with tstmgr

            narrator "I carefully leaned her back in the chair. Good, she didn't feel a thing."

            narrator "Uh huh!"

            narrator "What a cute bra!"

            narrator "... ... ... ..."

            narrator "But that is it. I want to do something more, but now it is not the time. She will wake up at any second. If she finds out what I am doing right now, our friendship will go to an end and she may even call the police. I don't wanna see that happen."

            scene b_love2_14 with tstmgr

            player "I'm just joking with you. I am a man of virtue, how could I take advantage of a sleeping girl?"

            player "You can check my cell phone if you want. I am perfectly clean."

            narrator "Eh... It's true that I didn't take her photos, but I have done something far more fucked up. She'll never know."

            player "Just relax, no one noticed you except me."
