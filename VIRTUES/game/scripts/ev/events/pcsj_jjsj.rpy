    scene e_mansiongate_day_smile with tstmgr

    e "It's good to hear that."

    player "During this time, Aunt Elisa, I will try my best to live on my own, just like everyone else."

    scene e_mansion_inside_tease with tstmgr

    e "I still remember that principal's face when he heard me saying this. That was really a funny face."

    player "(Feeling even more awkward) Yeah... haha..."

    e "If he knew what happened after we left, I bet his face would be even funnier."

    narrator "No, I can't let her keep saying this."

    player "(Interrupting) Aunt Elisa, I actually have a question for you."

    narrator "I also have that kind of doubt."

    scene e_mansion_inside_frown with tstmgr

    narrator "I don't believe my dad would keep a \"pure friendship\" with such a sexy lady for decades. I know what type of woman he likes."

    scene jjsj_d2 with tstmgr

    narrator "It can't even hide her underwear. Is she allowed to dress this in school?"

    narrator "White stocking with white lacy underwear. That's definitely a killing combo. Those high school boys must be crazy about her."

    scene mansion_inside_background with tstmgr

    narrator "Irene didn't give me much time to enjoy her dress. She grabbed my hand and lead me to her room."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "After that, I tutored Irene in mathematics for the entire afternoon."

    call screen hint("From now on, you will be able to come to Aunt Elisa's mansion for tutoring. It is a good way to improve the relationship between you and Irene.")
