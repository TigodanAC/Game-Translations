    "Later today, Senning and Lady Minna came to my house together while I wasn’t there."

    b "This is my mom. She just arrived in this country some days ago~"



    "Lady Minna" "It’s so nice to finally meet you, Vera. Senning has told me a lot about you~"



    "Lady Minna" "You can call me Lady Minna if you like."



    scene ab_duo_1_1 with tstmgr

    a "It’s so nice to meet you too, Lady Minna~"



    a "Please come in and... ..."

    "*Kettle Whistling sound* Whieeeeeeeeeeee~~~~~~~~~"



    scene ab_duo_1_4 with tstmgr

    a "Oh, the water is boiling! Please spare me for a moment!"



    b "Of course~"



    scene ab_duo_1_5 with tstmgr

    "Vera then ran to the kitchen... ..."



    "Lady Minna" "... ... ... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_6 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Be careful, daughter, don’t be fooled by her smile. That’s another opponent of yours."



    b "Ah? You mean... Vera is in love with [P] too?"



    scene ab_duo_1_7 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Oh of course she is. They are living together, for God’s sake."



    scene ab_duo_1_8 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "That girl might not be as lascivious as that Теодора, but she looks like a diligent girl who is good at houseworks. That makes her She a strong opponent for you."



    b "How did you know she is good at houseworks? You just met her."



    scene ab_duo_1_9 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Observe, girl, observe. This house is extraordinary clean so someone must do the cleaning every day. Who would it be? [P], that white-haired rich princess, or this brown-skin Cinderella?"



    scene ab_duo_1_10 with tstmgr

    b "Oh... ..."



    b "Yeah, Vera is indeed diligent and good at housework... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_11 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Does she cook well too?"



    b "I... I think so... ..."



    "Lady Minna" "Oh dear, that’s even worse. Have you heard that? ‘The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.’"



    "Lady Minna" "She might be an even stronger opponent than that Теодора... ..."



    b "Mama... ..."



    b "Why do I have to... compete with them? We can be friends and I’d like to share [P]’s love with them."



    scene ab_duo_1_12 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Naive girl, it’s not that simple. You can never avoid the competition in a harem."



    b "But... ... what will we compete for?"



    scene ab_duo_1_13 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "For example, your man’s first ejaculation every day is the thickest and contains the most semina. Whoever of you girls get it will have the higher possibility to be fertilized. You have to fight for that chance every day, girl!"



    b "Mama, that sounds crazy... ..."



    "Lady Minna" "Humph, have I told you that you have to get pregnant within a year in order to stay with him after your graduation? You don’t have time to waste and you have to take every chance!"



    b "Oh... ... ... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_14 with tstmgr

    b "But... ... how am I going to compete with Vera? I can’t cook as good as her and I’m not as skilled as her in housework either."



    scene ab_duo_1_15 with tstmgr

    b "Can you teach me those things, mama?"



    "Lady Minna" "Me? No, I know nothing about those things... ..."



    b "... ... ... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_16 with tstmgr

    b "Maybe I should find Vera directly and ask her to teach me~"



    "Lady Minna" "Hah? Why would you ask your enemy for help?"



    scene ab_duo_1_17 with tstmgr

    b "Vera is not my enemy, nor is Теодора. They are all super nice people!"



    b "I just want to make friends with them!"



    "Lady Minna" "Huh... ... ... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_18 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Whatever, girl, maybe I was a little too sensitive after all. You can do whatever you want, just be careful, okay? Sometimes women can be the most vicious creature in the world."



    "Lady Minna" "Find me in my hotel room if you need any help. I’m leaving now~"



    b "You are not staying here for dinner?"



    scene ab_duo_1_19 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Nope, I’m just here to see that Vera in person and I have gotten what I wanted. Now I’m going to meet Теодора’s mother, that blonde lady. That’s a really interesting woman~"



    scene ab_duo_1_20 with tstmgr

    b "Okay... ..."



    "Lady Minna" "See you, daughter~"



    scene ab_duo_1_21 with tstmgr

    b "Goodbye, Mama... ... ... ..."

    scene ab_duo_1_23 with tstmgr

    b "And now... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_24 with tstmgr

    a "Hmmmm? Senning, where is your mother?"



    scene ab_duo_1_25 with tstmgr

    b "She... left. She has something else to do."



    scene ab_duo_1_26 with tstmgr

    a "Oh no, was she angry at me because I left you here for the kettle? I’m so sorry!"



    b "She wasn’t angry, Vera. She left because she has a meeting with Теодора’s mother later."



    scene ab_duo_1_27 with tstmgr

    a "Oh, okay, that’s... great to hear."



    scene ab_duo_1_28 with tstmgr

    a "Anyway, come with me, Sen. [P] will be home very soon. Let’s prepare dinner together~"



    b "Oh, I... ..."



    scene ab_duo_1_29 with tstmgr

    a "What’s wrong, Sen?"



    scene ab_duo_1_30 with tstmgr

    b "Vera, may I ask you a question?"



    a "Of course~"



    b "Do you... ... love [P]?"



    "Vera’s action froze for a second, and then..."



    a "Yeah... ..."
