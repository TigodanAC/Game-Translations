    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "I basically lost my consciousness right after Aunt Elisa said that..."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "I don't know how long I passed out. The next thing I know is that I feel my head is lying upon a strange pillow. It is soft, but not as soft as cotton or foam. And It is warm and full of a woman's body scent."

    narrator "Is it... someone's lap?"

    narrator "Wait... so she is serving me a lap pillow? Well, that's... something."

    scene e_love2_4 with tstmgr

    narrator "Her tits are right above my head. I think I can easily reach them if I stick my tongue out. "

    narrator "Holy... to be honest, I have never seen anything more magnificent before. Her breasts are like two mountains hanging above my nose, like the sword of Damocles. But I am actually looking forward to seeing them fall on my face. "

    scene e_love2_6 with tstmgr

    narrator "I closed my eyes again. But actually I'm not trying to sleep."

    narrator "You see, now I am a fever patient, my mind is supposed to be messed up by my high body temperature, though it isn't, Aunt Elisa doesn't know that."

    narrator "And that means, she is most likely not going to judge my actions because she will believe that I'm doing them unconsciously."

    narrator "So... let's give it a try."

    scene e_love2_7 with tstmgr

    narrator "After pretending to sleep for a while, I turned my head aside. It was a well-calculated move and the angle is perfect. My nose is now contacting her right breast."

    narrator "Aunt Elisa quivered for a second, and that's all. She didn't do anything to me, neither wake me up nor move my head away."

    scene e_love2_8 with tstmgr

    narrator "Yes! I did it! Now my nose has reached the heaven. "

    narrator "And what should I do next? Should I continue and see how far I can go?"
