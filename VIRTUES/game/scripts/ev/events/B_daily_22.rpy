    player "Oh... eh... ..."



    b "My father is always busy at work. He doesn’t have enough time to spend with his family, and he has to divide the only time he has into 4 pieces to cover each of his wives."

    b "I just don’t get it. I mean, I know he is rich enough to do anything he wants, but why would he get so many wives if he doesn’t have enough time to spend with them?"



    b "He is just taking women as his... collections, as a way to show off his wealthiness. How disrespectful..."
