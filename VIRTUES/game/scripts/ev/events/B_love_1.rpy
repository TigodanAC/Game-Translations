    b "Fine, I forgive you."

    player "For real?"

    b "I don't even have a reason to get mad at you in the first place. I was angry because you didn't listen to me, but it's actually your freedom to not listen to me. I am not your girlfriend, I have no right to intervene in your life at all."

    player "No, no, no. I value your words very much. I've never been to nightclubs again since the last time we talked."

    b "Then what about that girl?"

    player "Girl? What gir... Oh..."

    narrator "Expensive? Well, it did cost me a lot of money, but it is definitely worth that much."

    narrator "Don't underestimate this girl in front of me. She is not just a normal college girl. She comes from a Chinese noble family. Perhaps her family is even richer than mine. But she just likes to keep a low profile. "

    player "Do you like it?"
