    "I decided to stay in Aunt Elisa’s mansion for tonight..."



    scene e_love_7_1 with dissolve

    player "... ... ... ..."



    "It’s the third time this week that I come and spent a night here. Am I expecting something?"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    "Yeah, of course I’m expecting something. I’m expecting that she could show up again and fuck me just like the last time."



    "That video... ..."



    scene e_love_6_20 with flashback

    "... ... ... ..."



    scene e_love_7_1 with flashback

    "Man, that was probably one of the best porn videos I ever watched in my life. It’s good to know that I was the man in that video, but it’s sad that I couldn’t remember anything of it."



    player "Elisa... ..."



    "She didn’t come to my room tonight, either."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "I tossed about for hours and still couldn’t sleep, so I decide to get up and get something to drink downstairs."



    player "Hmm?"



    "It seems like someone is in the swimming pool. Could that be... ..."



    "... ... ... ..."



    scene e_love_7_2 with dissolve

    e "[P]?"



    "It is really her!"



    player "Ah, hi, Aunt Elisa..."



    player "I heard some noises over here, so I just... came and check around."



    scene e_love_7_3 with tstmgr

    e "That’s nice of you~"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "What are you doing here, Aunt Elisa?"



    scene e_love_7_4 with tstmgr

    e "I couldn’t sleep... ..."



    "I could see the sorrow in her eyes. What happened that night is definitely haunting her."



    scene e_love_7_5 with tstmgr

    e "What about you?"



    player "I couldn’t sleep, either...."



    scene e_love_7_4 with tstmgr

    e "... ... ... ..."



    scene e_love_7_5 with tstmgr

    e "Do you want to... sit with me for a while?"



    player "I... yeah, sure."



    scene e_love_7_6 with tstmgr

    "I then took a seat next to Aunt Elisa."



    scene e_love_7_7 with tstmgr

    e "I still remember the time when you were only 8 years old and almost drowned in this pool. Time flies so fast... ..."



    scene e_love_7_8 with tstmgr

    player "Oh, I remember that, too. I was trying to help Theo find her toy at the bottom of the pool, but... I overestimated my diving skill."



    player "That was awkward... ..."



    e "Theo started to learn swimming after that day, and it soon became her favorite sport. I once asked her ‘why swimming?’, and she said..."



    scene e_love_7_9 with tstmgr

    e "‘So I can save his ass the next time when he tries to kill himself in the water again.’"



    scene e_love_7_10 with tstmgr

    player "The reason Theo likes swimming is because of... me?"



    e "Yeah~ She is adorable, isn’t she?"



    scene e_love_7_11 with tstmgr

    e "You two will be a great couple, I’m sure you will..."



    player "Aunt Elisa... ..."



    scene e_love_7_12 with tstmgr

    e "And, you know, I was thinking recently, that... ..."



    e "Maybe it’s time for me to change my lifestyle."



    player "What do you mean?"



    scene e_love_7_13 with tstmgr

    e "I mean, like... leaving the city and moving to the countryside, having a farm or something, like a recluse."



    player "Why... do you want to do that?"



    scene e_love_7_12 with tstmgr

    e "... ... ... ..."



    scene e_love_7_14 with tstmgr

    e "I once thought that I was a woman with a strong heart, but... ... it turned out I was wrong."



    e "I have messed up something recently and it is driving me crazy. Sometimes I don’t even know myself anymore."



    scene e_love_7_15 with tstmgr

    e "I’m afraid that things will go worse if I can’t find peace in my heart. I think I have to go to a place where I can relax and clear my mind... alone."



    player "Aunt Elisa... ... ... ..."



    "I know she is struggling with the guiltiness of having sex with me that night, but I have to pretend like I don’t know anything about it. Man, this is suffering..."



    player "Do you want to talk about it? What have you messed up?"



    scene e_love_7_16 with tstmgr

    e "Sorry, [P], but I... really can’t tell you."



    e "(I don’t want you to hate me... ...)"



    player "I see... It’s okay, you don’t need to feel sorry."



    e "... ... ... ..."



    e "I have already bought a Japanese-style bungalow in the suburb of the city and I’ll move there after Irene goes to college."



    scene e_love_7_17 with tstmgr

    player "What? But... what about your company?"



    scene e_love_7_18 with tstmgr

    e "It's time for Теодора to take more responsibility. I’ll gradually hand my power to her in the next few years. I’m sure she will do better than me."



    player "And... what about Irene?"



    e "My little girl has grown up. I might have spoiled her a little, but I know deep down inside she is an independent strong girl just like her sister. She will take care of herself in college."



    scene e_love_7_19 with tstmgr

    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "And... what about me?"



    scene e_love_7_20 with tstmgr

    e "W... what?"



    "She obviously didn’t expect that I would ask such a question. She surprisingly looked at me and almost lost her calmness."



    scene e_love_7_21 with tstmgr

    player "I... I will miss you so much if you leave."



    e "[P]... ... ... ..."



    scene e_love_7_22 with tstmgr

    "She then moved closer to me in silence and gently leaned her head on my shoulder."



    e "I will miss you, too, but... ..."



    scene e_love_7_23 with tstmgr

    e "(You are the reason that I have to leave. I have to... stay away from you before I get overwhelmed by my lust.)"



    e "I wish I could meet a man like you 20 years earlier. My life would have been so different."



    player "Aunt Elisa... ..."



    "That was almost like a love confession."



    scene e_love_7_24 with tstmgr

    e "Forgive me if I said something weird... and please... just let me have your shoulder for a little while."



    e "I really need it now... ..."



    scene e_love_7_25 with tstmgr

    player "... ... ... ..."



    "I never saw Aunt Elisa expressing her sorrow like this before. She is so eager to be loved. The void in her heart is tearing her apart."



    "She is a great woman who raised two daughters on her own and made them live in great wealth. But she never got a chance to pursue her own happiness."



    "That’s... not fair, not fair at all."



    "I want to... change this. I want to give her a happy life that she deserves because... ..."



    scene e_love_7_26 with tstmgr

    "I love her. Yeah, I think I have fallen in love with her. Life has made her suffer enough, now it’s time for me to step up and make up for her."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "... ... ... ..."
