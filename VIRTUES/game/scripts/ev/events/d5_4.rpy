    player "Just take this as my apology. You can live in that house until you find a better place, as long as you want."

    a "Why don't you live there yourself?"

    player "Me? Eh... I don't feel comfortable to live in such a big house alone. So I'm now living in a hotel suite."

    player "Nope..."

    "Father" "Oh, so you decide to live with another girl? "

    player "Nope..."

    "Father" "You... with a boy? You know, I'm OK with..."

    player "Dad!"

    "Father" "Nevermind. You don't need to tell me the reason. I'll transfer the ownership of that house to you since that is your wish."

    "Father" "You are indeed old enough to have your own estate."

    player "Thank you very much, dad. You are the best dad in the world."
