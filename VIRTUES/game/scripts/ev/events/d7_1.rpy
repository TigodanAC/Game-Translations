    c_qm "Wake up."

    c_qm "Waaake uuup."

    player "Zzz Zzz Zzz..."

    c_qm "Waaaaaaake uuuuuuuup."

    player "Hmm?!?"

    narrator "What the hell? Who's there? Is Теодора in my room again? This is the second time this week. Damn it, I can't stand it anymore. I swear I will..."

    player "Eh?"

    narrator "I opened my eyes."

    narrator "There is a girl lying on my bed and she looks just like Теодора's younger version. They both have emerald pupils and silver hair, but they are definitely not the same person."

    player "Irene?"

    d "Ah! You are finally awake, [P.name]."

    narrator "This is Irene, Теодора's little sister. They look similar, but their personalities are remarkably different. Unlike her bad-temper older sister, Irene seems to be much sweeter and cuter. We are very close since we were kids."

    narrator "Maybe... a little bit too close? I mean, she is now lying on the same bed with me and acts like nothing happened."

    player "Eh, why are you on my bed?"

    scene day7_d2 with tstmgr

    d "Just like what we did when we were small. Don't you miss it?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "When we were young, she loved to come to my home and play with me. Sometimes we would share the same bed at night and I would scare her with ghost stories. That was really a splendid memory."

    narrator "But now things have become weird. I mean, both of us have grown up. It is inappropriate for us to sleep together anymore."

    scene day7_d1 with tstmgr

    d " What's wrong?"

    player "Irene, we are not kids anymore. You can't just lie on the same bed with me like this."

    narrator "Do I really think it is inappropriate? Ha, not at all. No man would ever refuse to sleep on the same bed with an adorable girl like Irene."

    narrator "But I took her as my own sister. I have to say what I have to say."

    scene day7_d3 with tstmgr

    d "You don't like staying with me?"

    player "No, absolutely no. But you have grown up..."

    scene day7_d2 with tstmgr

    d "No, I haven't yet."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d4 with tstmgr

    narrator "Well, no matter how she denies it, her increasing breast size has proved everything. Although her tits are not as marvelous as her sister yet, I am very optimistic about her potential."

    narrator "These two adorable titties are right in front of my hands. If I touch them now..."

    narrator "Irene has never said no to my requests before. And for God's sake, she is now lying on my bed without any protection."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d1 with tstmgr

    player "(Nope, I can't do such things.)"

    player "(She lies on my bed because she trusts me and still takes me as a reliable big brother. I can't let her down.)"

    player "(Now let's just take this as a test of my endurance...)"

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Ah... those pretty legs and that cute panty..."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Wait, something is not right."

    narrator "My penis is getting harder every second... ... It's not my fault. Every healthy man would have an erection in my situation."

    scene day7_d2 with tstmgr

    d "Hah?"

    narrator "Oh, no. She noticed it."

    narrator "Irene came near me like a little snake. She seems to be curious about the change in my body."

    scene day7_d6 with tstmgr

    d "Why does it swell up..."

    d "Are you sick?"

    player "*Being awkward* Ha... No, I can... I can explain..."

    d "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d7 with tstmgr

    d "Are you heating up because of me?"

    player "Eh, well, about that... That's just a regular physiological change called “Morning Wood.” Haven't you heard of it at your physiology class?"

    narrator "Morning wood? How did I come up with that so quickly? I'm such a genius."

    scene day7_d8 with tstmgr

    d "Morning... wood?"

    player "Yes. Every grown male would get his morning wood every day. It's a signal of being healthy. That's all."

    d "So... It's not because of me?"

    narrator "Great, she believed in what I told."

    player "No, of course not."

    d "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d9 with tstmgr

    d "Are you sure of that?"

    player "Yes, I'm absolutely sure. There is no way for me to have sexual responses to you."

    d "... ... ... ..."

    d "I hate you! I don't want to talk to you anymore!!!"

    scene hotelroom1_background with tstmgr

    narrator "She got up from the bed huffily and then stormed out of my room."

    player "(What just happened?)"

    player "(Why did she piss off? I was just trying to act like a virtuous big brother.)"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "(I don't even know why she showed up in my room in the first place.)"

    player "Weird..."

    player "That was the third girl I pissed off this week. Ah... I'm getting used to it now."

    scene hoteldoor_background with tstmgr

    narrator "Suddenly, I heard someone opening the door."

    player "(Is she coming back?)"

    player "Hey, listen, Irene. I am sorry about......"

    player "Oh..."

    scene day2_c1 with tstmgr

    narrator "This time it was Теодора."

    c "What did you do to that little imp? She looks angry."

    player "I guess I said something wrong..."

    c "Ah, I don't even want to know. Just get on your clothes and go with me."

    player "go where?"

    c "My mom is holding a family picnic today, and she wants you to come, too."

    c "I texted you last night, didn't you receive it?"

    player "*Being awkward* Oh..."

    narrator "I didn’t get her text because I had already put her number on my blacklist since the last time we had a quarrel."

    c "Did you put me on the blacklist?"

    player "How did you... Shit..."

    player "Sorry."

    c "It doesn't matter. I just removed your number from my blacklist yesterday to text you~"

    player "Oh, ha..."

    c "Anyway, hurry up. You don't want to keep my mom waiting."

    player "Okay, okay."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."
