    e "You should take a shower right now, otherwise you may get a fever. "

    scene rcsj_e1 with tstmgr

    e "And... fever is not good..."

    narrator "Her face suddenly turned red. That was... actually cute."

    e "Oh, don't worry. I have some of your father's old clothes. I think you will fit."

    narrator "She seems not to want to explain that in more detail... Suspicious."

    narrator "But it's not a good time to dig into this. Aunt Элиза is right, I need to take a shower right now."

    narrator "I walked into the bathroom. "

    scene mansion_bathroom_background with tstmgr

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Well, this mansion has many bathrooms, and this is definitely the most magnificent one. I think it is even larger than my bedroom."

    narrator "I haven't been in here for a shower ever since high school. It kinda brings back memories..."

    narrator "5 years ago, when I was temporarily living in this mansion, there was a night..."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "5 years ago. Late night. In Элиза's mansion."

    player "(... ... ... ...)"

    player "(I want to pee...)"

    narrator "My bedroom has its private bathroom, but the closestool had some problems lately, so I have to go out and find another place to pee."

    narrator "I walked out of my room, and went to the nearest bathroom, which is also the biggest bathroom in this mansion. "

    narrator "I reached that bathroom, but found that the door was closed."

    player "(Is someone in it?)"

    player "(But I don't hear any voice, neither water flow or fan noise.)"

    player "(And everyone should have been in asleep by now.)"

    player "(... ... ... ...)"

    player "(Maybe someone just forgot to keep the door open when she left the room.)"

    narrator "I opened the door with a crack and saw the light coming out of it. "

    player "(Shit! Someone is really in the room!)"

    player "(Calm down, [P]. Just quietly close the door and pretend like nothing happened.)"

    player "(... ... ... ...)"

    player "(Wait... who is in it? There are only 3 people living in this place besides me. Aunt Элиза, Теодора, and Айрин. So whoever in this room must be a girl.)"

    narrator "I can feel that my face flushed. "

    player "(Should I take a look?...)"

    player "(But what if it is Айрин? I don't want to peep a 13-year-old girl.)"

    player "(I think I'll just close it.)"

    narrator "I was going to close the door, but suddenly, I heard a female's groan. "

    narrator "It was a groan in pleasure which sounded stirring and erogenous. I only heard this kind of voice in porn before."

    narrator "And I have recognized that voice. It was from Aunt Элиза."

    player "(Is she...)"

    narrator "My body froze for half a minute, then I started to tremble due to the great excitement."

    player "(God, I have to... see this...)"

    narrator "I got closer to the door... And I saw..."

    player "(Oh, my, God...)"

    player "(I have never seen a naked woman in the real life.)"

    player "(So that is how women masturbate?... Jeez)"

    player "(She seems to... enjoy it...)"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    player "(I never know Aunt Элиза can be so... erotic...)"

    player "(Look at those tits...)"

    player "(I wish I can put my dick in it some day...)"

    player "(... ... ... ...)"

    player "(Wait... what are you thinking, [P]? That's your aunt, not a blood-related one, but you started to call her your aunt since you were 5! Stop that dirty thought.)"

    scene rcsj_e4 with tstmgr

    e "Ahhh... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Aunt Элиза made a loud groan all of a sudden. Her body quivered, her breasts jiggled, and I saw water coming out of her pussy."

    player "(Holy shit. Did she just have a orgasm?)"

    player "(Is she... peeing?)"

    player "(... ... ... ...)"

    player "(It must be really enjoyable.)"

    player "(I think I'll have to jerk off tonight...)"

    scene rcsj_e5 with tstmgr

    narrator "After the orgasm ended, Aunt Элиза seemed to lose all the strength. She breathe heavily and her eyes looked blearily."

    e "That was... quite a cumming."

    scene rcsj_e6 with tstmgr

    e "Uh?..."

    narrator "Suddenly, she turned her eyes in my direction. "

    player "(Shit, does she see me?)"

    narrator "I didn't know if I was exposed or not. The light was dim and the door's crack was very slight. She was not supposed to see me."

    e "... ... ... ..."

    e "Weird. I thought I have closed that door."

    player "(Seems like she didn't see me yet.)"
