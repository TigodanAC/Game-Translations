    e "It’s so nice to have you here, Lady Minna~"



    "Lady Minna" "It’s my pleasure, Lady Shinyrost~"



    e "Is there anything I can help you with today?"



    scene special_1_2 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "No~ I’m just here for a chat~"



    e "Chat, huh... ..."



    "Lady Minna" "I heard that you have found a good young lad as the future husband of your daughter?"



    scene special_1_4 with tstmgr

    e "Oh?"



    "Elisa noticed the provocation in Lady Minna’s words."



    scene special_1_3 with tstmgr

    e "You mean [P]? Yeah, he is indeed a good young lad~"



    scene special_1_2 with tstmgr

    e "I heard your daughter Senning is his best friend in college, is that so?"



    "Lady Minna" "yeah, my daughter admires him~"



    scene special_1_5 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "And they are actually more than just... best friends~"



    scene special_1_6 with tstmgr

    e "Huh... ... They have fucked?"



    scene special_1_7 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "*Being a little surprised* Hmmmm?"



    scene special_1_8 with tstmgr

    e "Wait a minute, Lady Minna, you are not hoping me to give up [P] after I know about his affair with your daughter, are you?"



    "Lady Minna" "You... are not angry at him?"



    e "You are not angry at him either, so why surprised?"



    scene special_1_9 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "... ... ... ..."



    scene special_1_10 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "*Murmuring* What a lucky boy... ..."



    "Lady Minna" "Guess I still underestimated you, Lady Shinyrost~"



    "Lady Minna" "Alright then, let me be straight, this country doesn’t allow polygamy, which means... the boy may have as many girls with him as he wants, but he can only have one legal wife."



    e "And?"



    scene special_1_11 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Senning is my only daughter. You must understand that I have to fight for it for her."



    scene special_1_12 with tstmgr

    e "Oh, I understand... ..."



    e "But unfortunately [P] has already fallen in love with my daughter. She will be his legal wife, nothing can change that~"



    scene special_1_13 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Come on, we are all businesswomen, everything is negotiable. How much money do you want to give me this man?~"



    e "Humph~ I'd like to ask the same question to you, Lady Minna~"



    scene special_1_14 with tstmgr

    "Lady Minna" "Huh... ... Guess there is no way we can reach a consensus."



    "Lady Minna" "That will make us enemies. You know, I am willing to start a war for my daughter."



    scene special_1_15 with tstmgr

    e "So am I~"



    "Lady Minna" "Things will get really ugly... ... I can promise you that~"



    e "I’m very expecting~"

    player "Shit, when did you become so intimate with each other?"
