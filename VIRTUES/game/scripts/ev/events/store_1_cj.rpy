    "I don’t have many things to do this afternoon, so I decided to go downtown and do some shopping."

    player "Вера once said that she wants a new bra... ... yeah, I can buy one for her."



    player "And I want to buy Сеннин a new handbag as a gift, but I’m not sure if I can afford it... ..."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Maybe I should buy something for myself, too. I haven’t really bought myself anything after my dad went to jail."



    "I wandered around the street and tried to come up with a shopping list in my mind. I didn’t really pay any attention to the shops down the street because I have been here hundreds of times and I am familiar with every shop on this street."



    "But suddenly..."



    player "Emmmmm?"



    "I saw a strange little shop at the corner of the street. Is it a new one? I think I never saw it here before."



    "But this place has blended into the street so well. It doesn’t look like a new shop at all."



    "This is... strange. It feels like my memory is messing around with me. I am positive that I have been into every shop down this street before, how could I ignore this one for the entire time?"



    "I walked closer, and found out there was a dusty sign at the front door of the shop. It said ‘Posia’s Astrologer shop’."



    scene void with tstmgr

    player "Astrologer shop?"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Maybe I should get inside and take a look."



    "Thus I walked into the shop, and... ..."



    "I was stunned at what I saw immediately when I got into this place... ..."

    "There was a woman, a naked woman, catwalking in the room with a glass of wine in her hands and humming an unknown song."



    scene store_1_cj_3 with tstmgr

    "Her chubby butt shakes every time when she takes a step. I couldn’t move my eyes away from it."



    "Damn, is this place a secret brothel or something?"



    scene store_1_cj_4 with tstmgr

    player "Eh... excuse me?"



    scene store_1_cj_5 with tstmgr

    "???" "*Turned around* Hmmmm?"



    scene store_1_cj_6 with tstmgr

    "???" "Wait, are you a... real person?"



    player "What... what kind of question is that?"



    scene store_1_cj_7 with tstmgr

    "The naked woman walked to me without any embarrassment and stared at me like I was an alien or something."



    "???" "Are you... a customer?"



    player "Eh... that, that depends on what kind of shop this is..."



    scene store_1_cj_8 with tstmgr

    "???" "Didn’t you see the sign at the front door? This is Posia’s Astrology Shop~"



    player "Yeah... I did see that sign, but I have never seen any naked astrologer before... ..."



    scene store_1_cj_9 with tstmgr

    "???" "Oh, sorry about it, it’s just... no one ever came in my shop in the past 3 years, so... ..."



    player "Wait, what? I am your first customer in 3 years? How is that even possible?"



    scene store_1_cj_10 with tstmgr

    "???" "Only the chosen ones will step into my shop, so... yeah, you are the first one in 3 years."



    player "That doesn’t even make any sense..."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "On second thought, I came to this street almost every week but I never noticed your shop before."



    scene store_1_cj_11 with tstmgr

    "???" "But you noticed it today and chose to get inside. That makes you the chosen one~"



    player "So... you mean that all the people on the street couldn’t notice your shop in the past 3 years?"



    "???" "Uh-huh~"



    player "Does your shop have a magic shield or something that prevents people from seeing it?"



    scene store_1_cj_12 with tstmgr

    "???" "No, there is no magic in this world. It was just a cognitive science trick that could make most of the people ignore my shop."



    player "It’s weird to hear an astrologer saying things about... science."



    player "So... why would you want to make most of the people ignore your shop? I mean, no customer in 3 years? That was a tragedy."



    "???" "As I said, my shop only welcomes the chosen ones."



    player "But... you don’t worry about your income?"



    scene store_1_cj_13 with tstmgr

    "???" "Not at all~ I’m not a carnival charlatan who fools the kids for a living. I am Posia, the honorary president of the National Astrology Association. Money is never an issue to me."



    scene store_1_cj_14 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "But you still have to pay for everything you buy here. Rules are rules~"



    "Posia" "Don’t worry, I’ll give you a super sweet discount since you are the first chosen one who discovered my place~"



    player "The chosen one, huh... ... I still don’t know what that means..."



    player "Anyway, do you want to show me what you sell?"



    scene store_1_cj_15 with tstmgr

    "Posia" "Of course~ I’m sure you will find something you like~"
