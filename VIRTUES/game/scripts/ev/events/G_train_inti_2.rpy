            player "And for those foreign websites who are not restricted by the laws of our country, I got some good hacker friends who can deal with them too~ It’s a piece of cake for them to remove a few videos from websites without being noticed."

            player "And now~ everything is done. The internet is forgetful. Our image will gradually vanish from cyberspace and people will eventually forget us. By that time you won’t need to worry about being recognized on the street again."

            "I was wrong from the beginning. I thought she would be fine after I got her out of that city and provided her a better life, I thought she would be fine if she stays in this big apartment and not go outside."

            "It’s so ironic that my overprotection in turn made her feel even more insecure."

            "If we didn’t choose to run away, but choose to stay there and face the challenge together, would anything be different?"
