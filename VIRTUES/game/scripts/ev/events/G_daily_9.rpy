    "As Уно’s porn videos became more and more popular on the internet, my concern has grown as well. I am worried that her secret identity may get exposed."



    scene g_love_4_15 with flashback

    "I mean, she only used a blinder to cover her face in those videos, not even a mask, and she never hides her signature red-tressed hair as well. People who have seen her videos may really recognize her in the real life."



    scene void with flashback

    "I should spend more time with her to prevent the potential harassments that she may encounter. Yeah, I should definitely do that."



    "Let’s start with picking her up from work more often."



    "... ... ... ..."

    g "She will be jealous~"

    player "So... Уно, I have a question for you."



    g "Emmmm?"



    player "Aren’t you afraid that your real identity may get exposed if someone recognizes you after he watches your porn videos?"

    g "Of course I am afraid of that possibility, but I guess that’s the risk I have to take... since I have chosen this route... ..."

    player "I mean... we never held hands before, so I was thinking... ..."



    player "Since we are together now..."



    g "O... okay... ..."



    scene g_daily9_14 with tstmgr

    "She cautiously put her delicate little hand into mine and this was it, we are holding hands for the first time."



    "For some reason we all started feeling a little shy about it. Although we have done a lot of much more intimate things before, our hearts still beat fast when our hands were connected with each other."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Do you like how it feels?"



    scene g_daily9_15 with tstmgr

    g "I am more used to you touching my breasts instead of my hands but... ... either feels great... ..."



    "Passerby A" "Wow... look at that young couple. They are adorable..."



    "Passerby A" "I guess this is their first date. They look so shy and so nervous."



    "Passerby B" "I bet it will take them at least a year to move on to sex."



    "Passerby A" "Yeah, look at that girl’s dressing style. She must be a super conservative girl."



    scene g_daily9_16 with tstmgr

    player "*Noticed what they said* ... ... ... ..."



    player "(Super conservative?)"
