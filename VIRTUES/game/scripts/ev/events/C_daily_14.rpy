    "I came to the beach with Theodora today because she wanted to swim."



    scene c_daily14_1 with dissolve

    player "... ... ... ..."



    "Well, I don’t swim well so the only thing I can do is wait here for her while she is in the water."



    scene c_daily14_2 with tstmgr

    player "Ah... it makes me sleepy... ..."



    player "It seems like she is not going to get on land very soon. Maybe now I should go buy myself a drink... ..."

    "I then got up and went to the store nearby..."



    "... ... ... ..."

    player "Huh~~ Ice cold beer is always the best drink on a sunny day~"



    scene c_daily14_4 with tstmgr

    player "Hmmmm?"



    scene c_daily14_5 with tstmgr

    player "Hey man, what are in those red bottles?"



    "Store owner" "The aphrodisiac lotion."



    player "What? I... I don’t get it."



    "Store owner" "Eh... well, you see, people on the beach like to rub sunscreen for each other. That’s the ultimate flirting, don’t you think? A man and a woman, touching each other’s naked body with oil... ..."



    player "Eh... yeah... ..."



    "Store owner" "What they need now is just a little bit of a catalyst before going to sex, which is this, the aphrodisiac lotion that looks exactly like sunscreen~"



    "Store owner" "Many people come to buy it and rub it on their mate’s back by pretending that it is sunscreen. And... you know what will happen next, right?"



    player "Uh-hah... ..."



    player "Man... ... You are really a freaking commercial genius... ..."



    player "So how good your lotion is anyway? Can it really make people horny?"



    "Store owner" "Well, my friend, you will have to find out yourself. It is the bestselling product in my store. Do you need one?"



    scene c_daily14_6 with tstmgr

    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "Okay, I’ll have one. I’m... quite curious."



    scene c_daily14_7 with tstmgr

    "Store owner" "Here you are then, have a good time with your girl~"



    player "... ... ... ..."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "I left the store with a bottle of the aphrodisiac lotion..."



    "Sometime later..."



    scene c_daily14_8 with dissolve

    c "I’m back~"



    "Theodora seemed to be in a good mood after swimming."



    scene c_daily14_9 with tstmgr

    c "What’s that in your hand? Sunscreen?"



    player "Eh... ... yeah... ..."



    scene c_daily14_10 with tstmgr

    c "Do you want to rub it on my body?"



    c "Well, you should have done that an hour ago. Now I don’t need it anymore since we are about to go home. But... ... I'll still allow you to do it for me, as compensation for letting you wait for me for so long~"



    scene c_daily14_11 with tstmgr

    c "Or maybe... I can do something to make it up for you tonight... in your room... ..."



    player "Theo... ..."



    player "... ... ... ..."



    scene c_daily14_12 with tstmgr

    player "(What a fool I am. I don’t need this lotion at all. This lotion... is not for true lovers like Theodora and me. I’ll just ask her when I want to have sex with her.)"



    player "Let’s go home, Theo. You must be tired now~"



    c "Okay~"



    c "Seriously, when are you going to let me teach you swimming?"
