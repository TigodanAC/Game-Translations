    e "Awww... ... The sun is so beautiful today, it’s so sad that Irene couldn’t come with us."



    c "There is nothing sad about that. This is just a regular beach walk, mom. We can do this every day if we want."

    scene special_2_11 with tstmgr

    e "You are a crazy woman, I will be infected by your craziness if I talk with you."



    scene special_2_13 with tstmgr

    c "Eh... ... I don’t understand, do they have a beef?"



    scene special_2_14 with tstmgr

    scene special_2_20 with tstmgr

    b "Shouldn't we... stop them?"



    player "Nah, they both look scary right now. I don’t think it’s a good idea to interrupt them."



    player "Maybe they will chill down and become friends again when we come back. They are all grown ladies, they know what they are doing."

    b "... ... ... ..."



    b "Okay... ..."

    "... ... ... ..."



    "Sometime later, we came back and found that Lady Minna and Elisa were still arguing with each other. We had to drag them away from each other."



    "After that, the daughters took their mothers back to their own places."
