    a "Eh... What movie?"

    player "I don't know. A classic Korean romantic movie she said. "

    a "She didn't tell you the name?"

    player "She did, but I forgot. Most East Asian movie names don't make any sense when they are translated into English anyway. "

    "Well, the movie seems like a good one, but I soon found something that was even more attractive to me."

    "... ... ... ..."

    "Yeah, this scene is definitely better than the movie."

    "She wanted to say something, but somehow she didn't. "

    "Seems like she has acquiesced in my action."
