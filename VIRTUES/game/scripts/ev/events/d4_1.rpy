    narrator "I slept very well last night. It seemed like I was not resting on my bed. This bed was way harder than mine, but it didn't affect my sleeping quality."

    narrator "I also had a wet dream while sleeping."

    scene day3_a12 with tstmgr

    narrator "In that dream, I had an incredible sexual experience with a girl, a Cinderella-type girl."

    scene day3_a19 with tstmgr

    narrator "She was pretty, and I was crazy for her. I fucked her so hard, like a beast in season."

    scene day3_fix_27 with tstmgr

    narrator "I ejaculated my load in her body as a total conqueror. It doesn't like what a man of virtue would do, but I don't care."

    scene void with tstmgr

    narrator "It's nothing but a dream, no one cares."

    narrator "Zzzzzz, zzzzzzz, zzzzzzzz..."

    a "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"

    narrator "What kind of wake-up service is that? That scream is like a knife stabbing in my hangover head."

    narrator "Ah... Shit, my head hurts like hell..."

    a "Who the fuck are you!?!?!?!?!?!?!"

    player "What... What are you... What happens?"

    scene a_initial_background with tstmgr

    narrator "I painfully opened my eyes and found out that I am lying in an unfamiliar bed. The room looks unfamiliar, too. Where am I? It's not like any place I know..."

    narrator "Ew... It's like a slum shithole... How did I end up being here?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "Oh, shit..."

    scene day4_a1 with tstmgr

    narrator "A naked girl is standing in front of me, a girl with a pretty face and beautiful wheat-color skin. Maybe she has Latin American or Mideast descent?"

    narrator "She is now covering her private part with one hand and her breasts with another. But her breasts are too huge to cover. It makes her look even more erotic."

    narrator "Why does she look... exactly like the girl I dreamed about last night?"

    narrator "Wait..."

    narrator "Fuck!"

    narrator "So that was not a fucking dream at all! I truly did sleep with this girl last night."

    scene day4_a2 with tstmgr

    a "You... You... You demon! What did you do to me!?"

    narrator "What did I do to you? How the hell could I remember! I was drunk as fuck!"

    player "Sorry... Hey... Listen, Miss. We don't seem to know each other. There might be some mistakes..."

    narrator "Mistakes? No no no, I don't even buy that myself..."

    scene day4_a3 with tstmgr

    a "I will kill you! I will kill you!"

    narrator "She rushed over to me. But this attack had no threat at all. I was actually enjoying this, you know, the strengthless punch from a naked beauty."

    narrator "But... I have to calm her down now."

    scene day4_a4 with tstmgr

    player "Listen, Miss, you need to calm down. We were both drunk last night, remember? I want to figure out what happened last night the same as you do. So let's figure it out together, okay?"

    player "And... it's quite inapproriate for you to... be like this, don't you think? You'd better get some clothes on."

    scene day4_a5 with tstmgr

    a "Huh?... ..."

    narrator "She suddenly realized that she was exposing all her private parts to me."

    scene void with tstmgr

    a "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Sometime later..."

    scene day4_a6 with tstmgr

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "To be honest, Miss, I can barely remember anything last night. But it seems like we had a good time in the nightclub."

    player "I suggest we start over now and introduce ourselves."

    player "My name is [P.name], and you are?"

    scene day4_a7 with tstmgr

    a "Вера..."

    player "Nice to meet you, Вера."

    narrator "She responded to me with only a humph."

    scene day4_a6 with tstmgr

    a "I wish we never met... ..."

    player "Look, Miss. I was deeply sorry for what happened last night, but both of us have the responsibility. You can't blame it all on me."

    scene day4_a8 with tstmgr

    narrator "Вера suddenly cries out."

    a "Then what do you want me to do? You took my virginity! You, a nightclubbing playboy, took my virginity!"

    narrator "Wait, I took her virginity?"

    scene day4_a9 with tstmgr

    a "I shouldn't go to that party in the beginning. I should have realized that there will be a demon like you hiding in that place. Gods... Now it's too late."

    a "I should have listened to my mom and never come to this city. This place is... this place is... this place is full of traps..."

    narrator "Her emotion became very unstable again."

    player "Okay, Вера. I understand your feeling. Believe me, I will make up for you."

    scene day4_a10 with tstmgr

    a "How could you possibly make up for me? You know nothing about me!"

    player "How about this? I will give you money, a lot of money. You can use this money to buy anything you want. Let's just... move on, alright?"

    scene day4_a11 with tstmgr

    a "Do I look like a prostitute to you?"

    player "You know that's not what I mean. Come on, just look around."

    scene day4_a12 with tstmgr

    player "You are living in a room even worse than a jail cell, that is because you can't afford to live in a better place, right?"

    player "Just admit it, You need money pretty bad."

    scene day4_a11 with tstmgr

    a "It's none of your business!"

    a "I would rather die than trade my virginity for money..."

    player "But..."

    a "Stop using your dirty money to insult me. Haven't you insulted me enough?"

    player "Sorry..."

    scene day4_a13 with tstmgr

    a "My life is a piece of shit..."

    player "There must be a way for me to make up for you. Please tell me, please. I am willing to do anything to make you feel better."

    scene day4_a11 with tstmgr

    a "You don't need to pretend like a good man. Get out of my house. I don't want to see you anymore."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Maybe it is better to leave her alone for now. I will try to do something later after she calms down."

    player "Fine, I'll leave. If you need anything or any help, please just call me. Here is my number..."
