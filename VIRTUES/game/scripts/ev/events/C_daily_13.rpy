    scene c_daily13_3 with tstmgr

    c "Eh... it is crowded."

    scene c_daily13_4 with tstmgr

    e "Crowded? Oh, yeah, [P] is hosting b&b service in his place. There must be many guests living there."



    scene c_daily13_5 with tstmgr

    player "Hmm? What is it?"



    scene c_daily13_7 with tstmgr

    scene c_daily13_8 with tstmgr

    c "Relax, I was just joking. I don’t really care about it."

    c "... ... ... ..."



    c "You didn’t talk much tonight. What was on your mind?"



    player "I was thinking... ... maybe we can create a swimming pool in the house."



    scene c_daily13_13 with tstmgr

    c "Wait, you really took that seriously? I was just joking."



    scene c_daily13_14 with tstmgr

    player "So which plan do you prefer? Outdoor pool or indoor pool?"



    c "[P]... ..."



    scene c_daily13_15 with tstmgr

    c "Indoor. It will make me feel safer."



    player "Alright. What do you think if we make a pool in the basement? We have a huge basement but it was kept unused for a long time. It could be a perfect location."



    scene c_daily13_16 with tstmgr

    c "Whatever you like~"



    "Her voice sounded happy and airy. I think I never heard her talking like that before."



    scene c_daily13_17 with tstmgr

    "It may take months to build that pool, I’d better make a detailed plan for it later..."
