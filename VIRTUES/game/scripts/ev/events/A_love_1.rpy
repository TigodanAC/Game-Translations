    narrator "Our relationship has improved a lot during these days. She has basically walked out of the unpleasant memory. Now she takes me as a friend. And in fact, I may be her only friend in this city."

    narrator "In fact, I think it's about time I pay her a visit."

    narrator "I know she has to work through Monday to Saturday, so I'll wait until Sunday."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Well, this is strange."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Du... Du... Du... Du..."

    narrator "She didn't answer the phone, either."

    narrator "I started to get worried about her. What if she is now in the house and having some trouble, for example, carbon monoxide poisoning?"
