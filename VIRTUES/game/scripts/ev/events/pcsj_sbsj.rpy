    scene company_background with tstmgr

    narrator "The next morning."

    narrator "I came to Aunt Элиза's company."

    narrator "In the next few months, or even the next few years, this job may be my primary source of income, and Теодора will be my supervisor. God, I can't even imagine how hard it will be."

    narrator "But I have to work as hard as I can because now I am fighting for survival, and I don't want Теодора to look down upon me."

    scene c_company_normal with tstmgr

    narrator "I walked into the company and saw that Теодора is waiting for me."

    narrator "Wait, I never saw her dressed like this before. Is it her typical work dress?"

    narrator "She is wearing a business suit, but her jacket is open and exposing her bra out. Is that even legal?"

    narrator "This is the ultimate office temptation. I can't even imagine how could those male employees endure this every day."

    narrator "I really want to put my penis inside that cleavage..."

    c "What are you looking at?"

    player "Eh... Sorry."

    player "Your clothes are... nice..."

    c "... ... ... ..."

    scene c_company_smile with tstmgr

    c "Thanks."

    c "To be honest, I didn't expect you to come today."

    player "Why did you think that way?"

    c "Because I couldn't believe you would be willing to work under my command."

    player "Well, you are right. I am not willing to come here, but I don't have many choices. We all have to compromise with life, don't we?"

    c "... ... ... ..."

    scene c_company_tease with tstmgr

    c "Perhaps you have been really grown up for a little bit."

    c "Alright, enough for chatting. Now let me teach you the ropes."

    player "Cool."

    scene c_company_normal with tstmgr

    c "First of all, since you are still a junior student in college, we can only provide you with a part-time job contract."

    player "What does that mean?"

    c "That means your wage will be lower than regular employees, but on the other hand, your work time will be completely flexible."

    player "Wait a second, how much is my wage exactly?"

    c "50 dollars to 100 dollars per day, depending on your work time."

    player "??? Are you serious? That's basically the minimum wage that the government sets. I can earn more by washing dishes in a restaurant!"

    scene c_company_tease with tstmgr

    c "Well, this is the only contract you can get from me. It's your freedom to choose whether to accept this or find yourself a dishwashing job."

    player "What will Aunt Элиза think if she knows you are exploiting me?"

    c "She won't judge it. She took you as her own son, remember? If you can't even handle such an easy situation like this, you won't be worthy of being part of our family."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "What can I say? She is a freaking exploiter!"

    scene sbsj_c1 with tstmgr

    narrator "I really want to refuse her, but I don't have many choices right now. Besides, for the sake of those tits..."

    player "Alright, I'll take the job."

    scene c_company_slight_surprise with tstmgr

    c "(Slightly surprising)... ... ... ..."

    scene c_company_smile with tstmgr

    c "Interesting."

    c "Since it's a part-time job, you can freely decide your working time. You can come here every forenoon and afternoon from Monday to Friday, or just be absent for an entire week if you want."

    player "Eh? Won't you fire me if I do that?"

    scene c_company_tease with tstmgr

    c "No, but my mother won't be happy, and I will despise you for that as well."

    player "Okay..."

    c "Your wage will be paid into your account every night. Although you won't be able to earn much for now, your payment will increase along with your working experience."

    player "That sounds cheerful."

    c "During work time, you are supposed to report all your problems to me directly. My office is upstairs."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    c "Is there any other question?"

    player "... I'm fine now."

    scene c_company_smile with tstmgr

    c "Great, now enjoy your first day at work."

    scene company_background with tstmgr

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "... ... ... ... ... ..."

    call screen hint("From now on, you can choose to work at ShinyRost Inc. during weekdays. By working here, you will be able to earn a wage and develop your relationship with Теодора.")
