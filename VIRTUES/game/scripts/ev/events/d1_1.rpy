    player "Sigh... ... ... ..."



    "That was quite a weird dream. It was like a wet dream that only pathetic teen boys who have never dated anyone before would have."



    "And I am definitely not a pathetic teenager."



    "I am already 21 years old, currently a junior student at Rosco City University with a finance major. And I am a rich good-looking young man with a lot of one-night-stand experiences."



    "But... ..."



    "Sigh... ... I guess I am indeed a person who is eager to be loved."



    "That was... kinda normal for children who grew up in a single-parent family, right? My mother left us when I was a baby and I was raised by my father alone."



    "My father is quite a good dad though. He is a super successful entrepreneur, one of the richest and the most powerful dudes in this country. He spoiled me pretty hard. No matter what I want, as long as it has a price, he would get it for me."



    "He provided me a life of luxury. I can spend as much money as I want by using his checks and credit cards. Furthermore, he never married again to protect me from the potential of being hurt by a stepmother figure. What a great dad."



    "But still, the lack of mother’s love has created a gap in my heart and no matter how many things my dad did, he couldn’t fill it up."



    "This gap in my heart doesn’t really bring any negative effect to my life though. I don’t have any mental problems nor character defects."



    "But it indeed affected me in some minor ways, for example, I am more attracted by women with a pair of big tits because in my opinion that is kind of a symbol of motherhood."



    "Also, I always feel lonely and empty no matter how many friends I have or how many random girls I had sex with. I guess that’s why I had that dream earlier."



    "I am eager to find someone who can really fill this gap in my heart. A true love, yes. I am seeking to find my true love."



    "??" "(Pulling your shirt) ... ... ... ..."



    "Hmmmmmm... ... ... ..."



    "It feels like someone is standing behind me."



    "??" "[P], are you okay?"



    "I turned around and saw... ..."



    scene d1_1_8 with tstmgr

    "??" "You just slept in a class. Is everything alright?"



    scene d1_1_9 with tstmgr

    player "I... I’m fine, Senning."



    scene d1_1_8 with tstmgr

    "Senning, one of my best friends in college, an international student from China with 1/4 European descent, major in Math and Finance, the no.1 girl on my potential-true-love list."



    "I mean, take a look at her. How could anyone not want to have a romance with such a pretty?"



    "And yes, I have a potential-true-love list. Currently there are only two names on that list though."



    scene d1_1_10 with tstmgr

    b "You don’t look good today. Are you having a cold or something?"



    player "Oh... eh... no, I just didn’t sleep well last night."



    player "Thanks for caring for me, Sen."



    scene d1_1_11 with tstmgr

    b "Wummmmm... okay."



    scene d1_1_12 with tstmgr

    b "There will be a study group discussion at Rose Hall at 8pm tonight. Do you want to go with me?"



    player "What is it for?"



    b "For preparing for the economic exam coming next week~"



    player "But... you don’t need to go to that discussion, neither do I, right? We are like... the top 2 students in that class. The exam is just a piece of cake. Let’s go to a movie instead."



    "Yep, I sleep in class, I go to nightclubs for one-night-stands, but I am still a top student. I am a freaking genius~"



    scene d1_1_13 with tstmgr

    b "Yeah, but... there may be some people who need help."



    "This girl has a golden heart and she always wants to help others. That’s why I like her~"



    player "Okay, how about we go to a movie after that discussion ends?"



    scene d1_1_14 with tstmgr

    b "That will be too late, and... I don’t like to watch movies in theaters because there are no subtitles. I can’t understand the lines perfectly."



    "As an international student, Senning needs to work two times harder than local students. She not only needs to study her majors, but also needs to learn English from the very beginning."



    "I remembered that when she first came to this college, she could barely speak a complete sentence in English. After three years of studying, now she speaks like a professional, but she still prefers to read subtitles while watching movies."



    player "Sigh... ... ... ..."



    player "Fine, let’s just go to that discussion together."



    scene d1_1_15 with tstmgr

    b "Ah, thank you, [P]!~"



    b "I have a class 30 minutes later, I’d better go now and I will see you to...night... ..."

    b "I feel dizzy..."



    scene d1_1_18 with tstmgr

    "She suddenly lost her balance and fell to me."



    player "Hey, Sen, are you alright?"



    player "Sen... ..."



    "She passed out."



    "Well, she once told me about this, this hypoglycemia issue she has. Sometimes she will feel dizzy or even pass out for like a minute."



    "It is not a serious problem though. I’m not a medical student, but I think she can prevent it from happening by having some sugar regularly. But it seems like she hasn’t done that today yet."



    "... ... ... ..."



    "Well, there is another thing..."



    scene d1_1_19 with tstmgr

    "I realized that my right hand is grabbing one of her breasts now. I promise I didn’t do it on purpose. It was just a beautiful mistake."



    "But God, her breast feels like the finest water balloon. It is so soft... ..."



    scene d1_1_20 with tstmgr

    b "Wummmmm... ... ... ..."



    "She is waking up. I’d better move my hand away before she finds out."



    scene d1_1_21 with tstmgr

    b "Ehhhhhhh?"

    scene d1_1_10 with tstmgr

    player "I... I was just trying to... ..."



    b "I know, it’s my fault, sorry... ..."



    scene d1_1_11 with tstmgr

    b "How long did I pass out?"



    player "Less than a minute."



    scene d1_1_10 with tstmgr

    b "Sorry... ..."



    player "You haven’t had anything sweet today, have you?"



    player "I have some macarons in my car. If you like..."



    scene d1_1_24 with tstmgr

    b "Macarons!"



    scene d1_1_25 with tstmgr

    b "Wummm... no, I can’t eat any sweets. It will gain my weight."



    player "Are you serious?"



    scene d1_1_26 with tstmgr

    b "(Nodding) ... ... ... ..."



    player "Sigh... so how could you deal with this hypoglycemia issue without getting any sugar?"



    scene d1_1_25 with tstmgr

    b "Hmmmmm... ... ... ..."



    b "Fine... I will have a small piece of that... only a small piece... thank you..."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "... ... ... ..."



    "I took her the sweets in my car, and it turned out no girl can refuse the temptation of macarons. She ate not only one, but three whole pieces of them."



    "When she unconsciously reached out to the fourth piece, I made a cough."



    scene d1_1_27 with tstmgr

    b "Oh... I was... not going to eat that..."



    player "You don’t have to explain..."



    b "Hee hee~~~"



    b "I feel much better now, thanks. I should go for the class now."



    player "Okay... I’ll see you tonight."



    b "Bye bye~~"

    "... ... ... ..."



    "She is cute, isn’t she?"



    "I think I like her, and I think she likes me, too. I will definitely go pursue her if she is the only one on my potential-true-love list."



    "But there is another person on my list so I have to choose carefully. I don’t want to run into a stupid-romantic-movie situation of ‘I love you, but I then realize I love her more, but before she and I get married I realize that I actually love you more so I escape the marriage’ shit."



    "... ... ... ..."



    scene d1_1_28 with dissolve

    "Evening, at the study group discussion..."



    "Senning is really the savior of the underachievers. She answered all the questions with patience, just like a real professor."



    "After two hours of Q&A, students were nearly done with the questions. Many started to chat around, and the others were about to leave."



    "A student came up to Senning and me."



    "Student A" "Yo, guys, thanks for coming to this discussion. You really helped us a lot."



    "Student A" "I mean, you guys seemed to know everything about this exam and you don’t need to study with us at all, but you still came and didn’t hesitate to help us. We are very grateful for that."



    scene d1_1_29 with tstmgr

    b "You are welcome. We love to help whoever needs help, don’t we, [P]?"



    player "I... eh... yes, we are good people."



    "Student A" "You are such a great couple. Good luck on the exam, guys."



    scene d1_1_30 with tstmgr

    "Senning suddenly blushed."



    b "(Whispering) We... we... we are not... a couple... ..."



    "Unfortunately, that student didn’t hear what she said since he already walked away and her voice is too low."



    b "... ... ... ..."



    "She is... really cute when she is being shy."



    player "Eh... Sen, do you need me to drive you to your apartment?"



    scene d1_1_31 with tstmgr

    b "Ahh? I... ... ... ..."



    scene d1_1_32 with tstmgr

    b "No... no need. It’s not far from here. I will just... go alone... ..."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "She then ran away from me and left the hall as fast as she could."
