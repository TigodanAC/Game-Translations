    player "You want to see me, Theo?"



    c "You know, you have been reported by some people for coming to my office too often and neglecting your own work."



    player "Oh... well, they do have a point."



    player "But why do I feel like they were reporting you as well?"



    scene c_daily16_2 with tstmgr

    c "Yeah, people have noticed our relationship and they said we are taking my office as a, I quote, love hotel."



    player "Sorry... ..."



    player "But I am the only one who will get a punishment, right? So what will I get? Will I be transferred to another department?"



    scene c_daily16_3 with tstmgr

    c "Yeah, you will get a new position... but not in another department."



    c "From now on, you will be my formal assistant~"



    scene c_daily16_4 with tstmgr

    c "That means you can come to my office whenever you want and stay here as long as you like. No one will judge you anymore."



    player "What? That doesn’t sound like a punishment at all. It’s a fucking promotion! We can have fun all day long!"



    c "Hummmm? A promotion? You really think it that way?"



    c "Well, congratulation then~ but being my assistant may not be as good as you think. This place is not a real love hotel after all~"



    player "Eh... what do you mean?"

    player "What? Wait... ... but... what about having fun?"



    scene c_daily16_7 with tstmgr

    c "Let’s talk about that after you finish the job, shall we? Now hurry up~"



    player "... ... ... ..."
