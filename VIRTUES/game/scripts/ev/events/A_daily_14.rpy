    scene a_daily14_3 with tstmgr

    a "Awwww... I envy you so much!~"



    "It’s not the first time that Вера shows me her yearning for college life. And I feel kinda sorry for her every time I see the eagerness in her eyes."

    "Woman" "So what about you? You were the top student back in our middle school. How did you end up becoming a... salesperson?"



    scene a_daily14_2 with flashback

    player "... ... ... ..."

    a "I know I don’t have the chance to be a real D.A. anymore, but... ..."



    player "A D.A.? That’s so cool!"



    scene a_daily14_5 with tstmgr

    a "*Groaning sadly* It’s... embarrassing to even bring that up. That was just a childish dream. Sigh... ..."



    scene a_daily14_6 with tstmgr

    a "On second thought, I don’t need those books at all. Maybe we should just... leave here."



    "Damn, I thought bringing her here would make her happy, but now she is even more upset than ever. I have to do something about it!"

    player "... ... ... ..."



    player "If that is what you want... ..."



    scene void with tstmgr

    "Guess now I have finally found out the real reason why she still chooses to work like crazy even though she doesn’t have to. It is all because of the lack of security. She feels so insecure when she is with me and damn... I have no idea how to solve it."



    "The more I try to do something for her, the more she will think ‘this life doesn’t really belong to her’ and the more insecure she will feel. Ahhh... shit, this is an endless loop!"



    "Think, [P], think, there has to be a way..."



    "But right now... maybe I should just leave this place with her."



    "... ... ... ..."
