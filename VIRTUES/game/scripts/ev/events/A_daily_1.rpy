    "Restaurateur" "You know, I raised Вера's wage recently."

    player "For real? That's not like you. You are practically famous for your parsimony."

    "Restaurateur" "That's because I believe none of my other employees deserve a higher wage. Вера is different, however. She deserves more."

    player "Why is that?"

    "Restaurateur" "Because she can do everything! Hosting, serving, cleaning the kitchen and restrooms, you name it. I've never seen any of my employees have such a passion before."

    player "What the fuck are you talking about?"

    player "You made her clean the kitchen and restrooms?"

    "Restaurateur" "Hey, don't get mad at me. She volunteered to do all those things. You'll know what I'm talking about if you spend some time with her. That girl has so much energy."

    "Restaurateur" "Besides, that's why I decide to raise her wage. I would never mistreat such a good employee."

    player "o no no, she is not here to be your janitor."

    "Restaurateur" "And I am not treating her like a janitor, either, am I? Now she earns about two times more than a normal server does. If she stays here longer than a year, I may even make her my service manager."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "I lifted my head up, and saw the back of Вера's figure serving a table of guests."

    narrator "Indeed, just like the restaurateur said, she is so energetic. No matter what she had been through, she still seems to embrace her life with full of optimism and passion."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Perhaps I was worried too much."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."
