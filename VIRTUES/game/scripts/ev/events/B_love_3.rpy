    b "I got an F on my last paper..."

    player "I'm gonna kill that bastard..."

    player "Wait, what?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "That's the reason you cry? One F in an assignment?"

    narrator "Senning nodded her head."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "I don't know what to say, girl."

    player "I mean, you freaked me out on the phone. I thought you might have encountered something... more serious."

    b "But I never got an F before..."

    player "Well, it is indeed a frustrating thing. But you know, failure breeds success, it will become a valuable experience and make you a better person."

    player "It's not a big deal anyway. It's just an assignment, not a final exam. You can still catch up."

    b "... ... ... ..."

    b "It's just a stupid mistake. I digressed from the subject."

    player "Sounds like a mistake that I would make. You know, I'm a terrible writer, writing a paper is nothing but torture to me. "

    player "But you are different. I've seen your papers before, and I know how good you are. Your ideas and attitudes are just amazing. "

    player "Just try harder next time, and I'm sure you will surprise the professor."
